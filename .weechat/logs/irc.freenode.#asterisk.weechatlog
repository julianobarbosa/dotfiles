2015-12-28 21:17:56	amonk	hey.  i'd still like to know if anyone knows if asterisk plays nicely with zrtp now. tia
2015-12-28 21:18:22	WIMPy	amonk: not available
2015-12-28 21:18:53	amonk	WIMPy: can you explain that?
2015-12-28 21:19:15	WIMPy	What exactely is the to explain?
2015-12-28 21:19:35	amonk	it's extremely ambiguous
2015-12-28 21:19:47	amonk	especially not being a sentence and all
2015-12-28 21:19:58	WIMPy	There is no zrtp support in Asterisk.
2015-12-28 21:20:08	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: in the xml config file you should be able to set per line sipproxy
2015-12-28 21:20:34	amonk	okay, so it still doesn't play nicely.  check.  thanks.
2015-12-28 21:20:41	WIMPy	MaliutaLap: That doens't seem to work. Neither with host name nor IP.
2015-12-28 21:20:51	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: I'm just trying to verify that's valid for the 9971's
2015-12-28 21:21:12	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: have you seen http://labs.wrprojects.com/configuring-a-cisco-9951-phone-for-asterisk/ ??
2015-12-28 21:21:31	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: it's for the 9951, but looks like it should valid for the 9971
2015-12-28 21:22:24	WIMPy	MaliutaLap: That example also just uses te USECALLMANAGER. But that makes it impossible to configure more than one host.

2015-12-28 21:32:32	WIMPy	MaliutaLap: But it doesn't work at all.
2015-12-28 21:32:43	WIMPy	It only works with USECALLMANAGER.
2015-12-28 21:33:27	MaliutaLap	well they are designed for that purpose ... using them with something else is a bit of a hack :)
2015-12-28 21:33:47	WIMPy	MaliutaLap: http://uck9.blogspot.de/2012/06/9971-phones-need-at-least-one-dn.html does that ring a bell? I'm not sure what DN means here.
2015-12-28 21:34:36	WIMPy	Well, it works with EITHER the FritzBox OR Asterisk that way, as you can't specify more than one host that way.
2015-12-28 21:38:09	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: well, that puts a spanner in the works
2015-12-28 21:39:06	WIMPy	Yeah, it's kind of uncool.
2015-12-28 21:40:10	WIMPy	MaliutaLap: Does that "DN" from that article mean anything to you?
2015-12-28 21:42:38	MaliutaLap	I would have thought "Domain Name" or "Distinguished Name"
2015-12-28 21:42:44	MaliutaLap	probably the later
2015-12-28 21:43:17	 *	WIMPy could also only come up with Domain Name.
2015-12-28 21:43:26	WIMPy	But where to put that?
2015-12-28 21:44:55	WIMPy	Maybe "Directory Number"?
2015-12-28 21:44:56	MaliutaLap	it it's Distinguished Name then it'll be something Cisco Manager related
2015-12-28 21:45:01	MaliutaLap	could be
2015-12-28 21:45:17	WIMPy	Must be something on the phone though.
2015-12-28 21:55:56	amonk	WIMPy: seems like it can be done with direct media. fyi
2015-12-28 22:01:29	WIMPy	amonk: That sounds like a bit of hit or miss to me.
2015-12-28 22:08:25	amonk	WIMPy: yeah, it's not ideal, but it looks doable
2015-12-28 22:09:13	WIMPy	Using somethign end2end through something that by definition is an endpoint soulnds like a questionable concept anyway.

2015-12-28 22:13:43	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: http://www.cisco.com/image/gif/paws/113048/reg-9971ip-cucm.pdf <- seems to indicate DN is "Directory Number"
2015-12-28 22:14:25	WIMPy	MaliutaLap: But where would that appear in any of the XML files?
2015-12-28 22:15:10	WIMPy	I don't find anything number other that the voicemail extension.
2015-12-28 22:24:41	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: yeah, not finding much on getting the 9971's working in that way
2015-12-28 22:24:52	MaliutaLap	WIMPy: most example are just to a single * server
2015-12-28 22:25:30	WIMPy	Guess that's just a case of bad luck.

2015-12-30 14:33:45	game0	hello guys, I have installed asterisk server in virtualbox and my problem is that I'm trying to use putty to connect to the server
2015-12-30 14:33:53	c0ldg0ld	@file: I've noticed nearly every tutorial on installing asterisk first starts with disabling selinux.  There appears to be a profile for selinux with asterisk but danged if I can get it to work properly.  Is this profile old and doesn't work with the new versions?
2015-12-30 14:33:59	game0	but the problem is that the server isn't pingable
2015-12-30 14:34:16	@file	I have no idea
2015-12-30 14:34:22	game0	so what's my problem?
2015-12-30 14:34:28	c0ldg0ld	game0:  Sounds like an error with your virtual box networking
2015-12-30 14:34:42	game0	then how can I solve it
2015-12-30 14:34:48	c0ldg0ld	well...
2015-12-30 14:35:21	c0ldg0ld	Try switching your asterisk virtual over to "host only" and see if you can see it then
2015-12-30 14:35:33	c0ldg0ld	are your ip addresses for both boxes even on the same subnet?
2015-12-30 14:36:10	c0ldg0ld	sorry let me back up a bit... are you familiar with the virtual machine settings inside virtual box?
2015-12-30 14:36:14	game0	I can connect to the network throw asterisk but my machine is not able to connect to astersik
2015-12-30 14:36:24	game0	no not that much
2015-12-30 14:36:41	c0ldg0ld	check the ips of both your host machine and the asterisk machine
2015-12-30 14:36:52	game0	different domain
2015-12-30 14:37:06	c0ldg0ld	I'd venture a guess that they aren't on the same subnet, probably nat on the virtual
2015-12-30 14:37:13	game0	yes different subnet
2015-12-30 14:37:43	game0	my laptop is 192
2015-12-30 14:37:48	c0ldg0ld	you could, if you want, set the virtual to be in "bridged mode" I think it is, it will explain off to the side that one of the selections will put it on the same physical network as your host machine
2015-12-30 14:37:54	game0	and the virtualbox 10
2015-12-30 14:38:02	c0ldg0ld	yeah that's the issue then
2015-12-30 14:38:31	c0ldg0ld	Go ahead and shut down the virtual, then go into the settings for the virtual and find the network settings
2015-12-30 14:39:17	c0ldg0ld	then tell me what you see in there
2015-12-30 14:39:49	game0	attached to : bridged adapter
2015-12-30 14:39:53	game0	you mean that ?

2016-01-04 08:30:31	gavimobile	i think it used to be on my pbx that it would forward the call to my cellphone if i wasnt there and if i didnt answer on my cellphone than the caller would recieve the voice mailbox for that extention rather than my celphones voicemail
2016-01-04 08:32:32	Chainsaw	gavimobile: Generally you can deactivate the voicemail forwarding via the cellphone.
2016-01-04 08:32:52	Chainsaw	gavimobile: In which case it would simply ring longer, and you can then cut in your Asterisk voicemail when you see fit.

2016-01-26 13:25:55	Lope	Previously, before I used a queue. I was using MixMonitor to setup the call recording, and I was using StopMixMonitor() after Dial() finished. Now that I'll be using a queue with MixMonitor enabled for the queue I guess the queue will call StopMixMonitor on it's own when the queue exits?

2016-01-26 13:30:04	[TK]D-Fender	You should really go read the queue config sample.

2016-01-26 13:30:30	[TK]D-Fender	Typcailly you only want to record a n actual conversation... which means a BRIDGED call.
2016-01-26 13:30:34	[TK]D-Fender	And there are options for that

2016-01-26 13:34:40	stefan27	After setting outofcall_message_context = messages in sip.conf, then when an (unregistered) sip friend sends a SIP Message (out of dialog) asterisk creates something called "Message/ast_msg_queue" which executes dialplan in the context 'messages'. Can I from that context extract the SOURCE IP of the received sip message?

2016-01-26 13:38:10	Lope	QUEUE_MEMBER_COUNT should do it?

2016-01-26 13:51:22	@mjordan	Lope: there are specific device states for queues that you can query using the same dialplan function
2016-01-26 13:51:53	@mjordan	For queues, it should be "Queue:(name)_avail" if at least one member is available in the queue
2016-01-26 13:52:52	@mjordan	For the paused status of a queue member in a particular queue, it is "Queue:(queue_name)_pause_(member_name)"
2016-01-26 13:53:03	Lope	mjordan: thanks. Basically I want to use QUEUE_MEMBER_COUNT to determine whether to tell the caller that nobody is online and tell them how to send an email or offer them to leave a voice mail.
2016-01-26 13:53:26	@mjordan	Lope: if the Queue is unavailable, that would be the same thing

2016-01-26 13:55:50	[TK]D-Fender	beacuse only allowing one... sounds pointless. might as well be a straight dial
2016-01-26 13:56:10	Lope	I intend to add more members though.
2016-01-26 13:56:14	Lope	It's a startup :p
2016-01-26 13:56:16	[TK]D-Fender	you said you would redial if they were busy
2016-01-26 13:56:31	[TK]D-Fender	but leaving the queue ... or deciding not to even go in is completely contradictory
2016-01-26 13:57:57	@mjordan	Lope: It's a lot trickier than that. It means that the configuration of the channel driver has told us that the device that maps to that device state (which in turn maps to a Queue member) has told us that they can have another channel.
2016-01-26 13:58:13	Lope	I think there's been a misunderstanding. GotoIf($["${QUEUE_MEMBER_COUNT(myqueue)} != 0]?enterqueue) this allows the caller into the queue if there are any members online. BUSY or NOT_INUSE. If there are no members online, I provide the email address and offer them to leave a voicemail.
2016-01-26 13:58:15	@mjordan	Lope: Generally, that means they don't have a channel going to their device.
2016-01-26 13:58:25	@mjordan	But you can have configurations where a SIP device can have multiple channels.
2016-01-26 13:59:13	Lope	mjordan: oh, well my SIP devices are all softphones, and can only take 1 channel.

2016-01-26 14:05:07	Lope	TKD: Even though I'll only need to add more than 1 member to the queue later, I opted for a queue right now for a number of benefits. 1: if I'm busy, the caller can listen to music briefly and I can still take the call if they wait. 2.

2016-01-26 14:05:57	Lope	TKD Oh I see what you're saying. It would be better to rather let the queue give me an error message.
2016-01-26 14:06:16	Lope	Because there might be members in the queue when I send the caller in, but of all the members leave I need to handle the caller the same way.

2016-01-26 23:04:41	djiboutiii	Hello - looking for some assistance. My setup worked fine for a year, but now isn't working. Incoming phone calls reach the asterisk server, are then forwarded to a cell phone. When the cell phone answers, neither party can hear one another. I think I've narrowed it down to RTP packets not being receieved. When I turn that debug on, it only shows RTP packets sent. There is no "Get RTP packet"
2016-01-26 23:05:15	djiboutiii	Any ideas?

2016-01-26 23:07:26	WIMPy	And also check that Asterisk is using the correct IP.
2016-01-26 23:07:43	djiboutiii	Looks like the IP is fine, assuming you mean external IP?

2016-01-27 09:26:55	snadge	clearly users depend on being able to set custom CDR variables in the hangup context or as part of a hangup handler

2016-01-27 12:50:05	@mjordan	catphish: That's actually a loaded question. Do you mean Asterisk managed transfers, or transfers that occur as a result of a communications protocol?
2016-01-27 12:50:40	catphish	that's a good question, i'm talking about those that are initiated by PJSIP endpoints during a call
2016-01-27 12:51:17	catphish	both blind transfers, where one side of a call is "redirected" mid call, and attended transfers, where 2 existing calls are merged
2016-01-27 12:51:49	@mjordan	wrt to PJSIP, that's going to follow closely to what you'd find out there on the interwebs if you look for SIP transfers
2016-01-27 12:52:11	@mjordan	Where it will be different is that most documentation will treat that as if you were transferring between three phones
2016-01-27 12:52:32	@mjordan	in the case of Asterisk, however, as a B2BUA, it will look a little different, as it is one of the "phones" in the triad

2016-01-27 12:54:29	@mjordan	There's a lot of subtle variants here as well, as even with a SIP protocol initiated transfer, the target of the transfer may not be another PJSIP channel
2016-01-27 12:54:41	catphish	mjordan: from what i saw, with an "attended" transfer between 3 phones, asterisk uses a local channel to maintain the presence of a 3rd phone
2016-01-27 12:54:50	catphish	and keeps 2 separate bridges
2016-01-27 12:54:56	@mjordan	It does until you complete it
2016-01-27 12:55:25	catphish	you'd normally tidy up and merge the 2 bridges?
2016-01-27 12:55:51	@mjordan	When you do a transfer within Asterisk, that is, where the destination is another extension in Asterisk, something has to go and execute the dialplan.
2016-01-27 12:56:25	catphish	yes i see
2016-01-27 12:56:29	@mjordan	(This is attended, btw)
2016-01-27 12:56:56	@mjordan	We can't just use the transferring channel for that, as we have to move them around a lot (and rather carefully). So a Local channel goes and executes that dialplan, which (usually) dials another channel (your third phone). Interestingly enough, it doesn't have to of course: you can do an attended transfer into VoiceMail, for example

2016-01-27 12:57:53	catphish	i thought the channel doing the attended transfer just made a new, separate call, went through the dialplan as its own channel
2016-01-27 12:58:05	catphish	then the 2 were merged using a local channel
2016-01-27 12:58:20	@mjordan	possibly. It's been awhile since I've looked at it, and it also depends on the scenario.
2016-01-27 12:58:29	@mjordan	I might be getting mixed up with core transfers.
2016-01-27 12:58:43	@mjordan	Suffice to say: Local channel are used to massage the process at times.
2016-01-27 12:58:57	catphish	ok, certainly in my case, before it becomes a transfer at all, its just 2 totally unrelated calls with a sip endpoint in common
2016-01-27 12:59:02	@mjordan	However, in any attended transfer scenario, once completed, the target of the transfer is going to replace the initiator, wherever they happen to be.
2016-01-27 12:59:46	@mjordan	Yes. In an attended transfer, you have two separate "calls" (which is a loaded term); when completed, the REFER w/ Replaces tells Asterisk how to complete the transfer.
2016-01-27 13:00:22	@mjordan	There's a lot of variants to this
2016-01-27 13:00:29	catphish	ok, i think what i need to work out is how to properly complete the transfer (i'm using ARI to play with the channels, just getting my head around the processes)
2016-01-27 13:00:32	@mjordan	For example, there are scenarios where the second "call" is not within Asterisk
2016-01-27 13:00:51	@mjordan	catphish: With SIP level transfers, you don't have control of it in ARI. This is all being initiated by the phones.

2016-01-27 13:00:54	catphish	you're right, a UA could make a "call" to a completely different endpoint
2016-01-27 13:01:08	catphish	not asterisk at all
2016-01-27 13:01:24	@mjordan	catphish: what you have to do in your ARI app is understand when channels may leave you. When someone does a SIP level transfer, they're going to yank the channels either out of your ARI app, or rudely shove one into your ARI app.
2016-01-27 13:01:35	[TK]D-Fender	Sounds generous that * would accept an off-* SIP call for reinvite like that....
2016-01-27 13:01:41	@mjordan	In either case, you should get a StasisEnd when a channel is transferred out of your app, or a StasisStart when they get put in.
2016-01-27 13:01:52	@mjordan	[TK]D-Fender: it does work in PJSIP land at least :-)
2016-01-27 13:02:20	@mjordan	no guarantee that where we're being told to send the call to exists, mind you, since we don't control it
2016-01-27 13:02:36	@mjordan	but if all of the SIP URIs are accurate and the specified dialogs exist, yadda yadda, it will toss it to the external party
2016-01-27 13:03:04	[TK]D-Fender	mjordan: PJSIP needs 2 serious mods : lack of externhost/externrefresh equivalent, and no permit/deny to restrict origin subnets/hosts.  CHOP CHOP! :p
2016-01-27 13:03:07	catphish	ok, i'll focus on stasisstart and stasisend, its somewhat important to me that i know what channels are bridged to each other so i can synchronize hangups
2016-01-27 13:03:47	[TK]D-Fender	(seriously needed, not not seriously difficult)
2016-01-27 13:04:32	catphish	thats the main reason i care, for example right now after a transfer completes the UA that initiated the transfer hangs up, and i stupidly assume that means the call ended, and hang up the remaining channels
2016-01-27 13:05:24	catphish	so as long as asterisk does the legwork, i just need to track who's talking to who, to ensure i hang up a call when only 1 party is left in it

2016-01-27 14:41:26	djiboutiii	Hello. I inherited an asterisk server recently that i need to support. I know very little. At the moment when we are receiving calls there is no audio. I think I've narrowed it down to RTP packets not being receieved, I can see that they are only being sent when the call is answered.
2016-01-27 14:41:40	djiboutiii	I realize it's most likely a port/nat/firewall issue, just unsure where to look.
2016-01-27 14:41:59	djiboutiii	In my sip.conf I've got externip set, localnet set, but nat was set to No when this was last working
2016-01-27 14:42:18	djiboutiii	My router has an iptable entry to accept traffic on 10k-20k ports
2016-01-27 14:42:25	djiboutiii	Im just a little lost.
2016-01-27 14:43:19	[TK]D-Fender	but nat was set to No <- this doesn't make sense yet if we're still looking at [general]
2016-01-27 14:43:30	[TK]D-Fender	And you haven't described where any of the ENDS of this call are
2016-01-27 14:43:42	[TK]D-Fender	and you should be showing us a failed call with SIP DEBUG enabled to look at

2016-01-27 15:45:57	djiboutiii	One thing I noticed is when I turned on RTP debug, only the SENT packets were going. I never got as "Got packet" message once the call was answered. The port for that was not in the 10k - 20k range
2016-01-27 15:46:08	[TK]D-Fender	it used to be it'd ignore settings after the first register

2016-01-27 15:55:09	[TK]D-Fender	We need to confirm that the IP's * tells them to send to is correct, and then double check every firewall & router again against rtp.conf as well

2016-01-27 16:43:50	djiboutiii	Right, it's done in the DD-WRT firewall. I'm researching now (ignorant of iptables too!) how to get that done in iptables.
2016-01-27 16:44:20	djiboutiii	It's using an older iptables v1.3.7 so it's taking a little trial/error.

2016-01-27 16:45:09	[TK]D-Fender	something referring to NAT or MANGLE for the table type to dump.

2016-01-28 08:14:06	jp47itc	or is it better to leave it empty?
2016-01-28 08:14:35	Kunsi	i only have "1000" in it, so someone can call 1000@kaworu.kunbox.net to dial me, otherwise empty
2016-01-28 08:15:13	Kunsi	if i had i extension in it, i'd no longer get "call rejected" in logs, which would break my fail2ban setup
2016-01-28 08:19:43	jp47itc	you mean invalid ext?
2016-01-28 08:20:03	jp47itc	which version of fail2ban?
2016-01-28 08:20:45	Kunsi	0.8.13-1
2016-01-28 08:20:50	Kunsi	and yes
2016-01-28 08:20:54	jp47itc	ok
2016-01-28 08:22:06	jp47itc	i think i have misconfigured fail2ban, i never have anyone on the banlist
2016-01-28 08:22:08	Kunsi	http://paste.debian.net/374058/ for asterisk security log, http://paste.debian.net/374059/ for "call rejected"
2016-01-28 08:22:17	jp47itc	oh, thx :D
2016-01-28 08:23:10	Kunsi	don't know if 1.6 already has security log
2016-01-28 08:23:16	jp47itc	i have to work with fail2ban 0.8.4 as this is an old server
2016-01-28 08:23:25	jp47itc	lets see, thx for the pastes :)
2016-01-28 08:28:02	jp47itc	do you have separate files for the filters?

2016-01-28 08:41:48	jp47itc	Kunsi: the call rejected filter does not anywhere in my log because there is no host in it.. but when i remove the HOST, fail2ban complains when testing the filter against the logfile: No 'host' group in 'NOTICE.* .*: Call from \'\' to extension \'.*\' rejected because extension not found in context \'default\'.*'

2016-01-28 08:45:41	jp47itc	yes, i did, but a test turned out that the regex doesn't match anywhere in my logfile..
2016-01-28 08:45:56	jp47itc	i think because of the HOST
2016-01-28 08:46:20	Kunsi	i don't really know
2016-01-28 08:46:43	Kunsi	works fine on asterisk 13.2

2016-01-29 12:52:20	Lope	BTW I realized using mp3s is kind of pointless. When you convert the mp3 to a signedint 8kHz file it's basically the same size as the mp3, without the CPU overhead. There are much bigger issues though. For example I needed to cut the beginning of my music file off so that the caller doesn't hear the whole quiet buildup, they just hear the medium buildup. And then also I had a problem where the voip call was clicking and popping due to the bass (i tried redu
2016-01-29 12:52:21	Lope	cing the volume to -9dB and it still clicked and popped on every bass beat. So then I ran a highpass filter of 800Hz on it and it worked even at 0dB (full volume). I actually settled on 12dB because VoIP music sounds like crap anyway, nobody wants to hear it blasting at them. It's basically there to keep you ever so slightly entertained until somebody picks up.

2016-02-01 14:27:08	c0ldg0ld	seem to be having an issue with latest versions of dahdi compiling completely.  I'll go through the same steps I have for years but at the end of it all "service dahdi start" yields a dahdi: unrecognized service
2016-02-01 14:28:20	[TK]D-Fender	That's just an init script issue at worst
2016-02-01 14:28:31	c0ldg0ld	anyone else seen this?  I've tried running make config again and I've found an older tarball, compiled that, then compiled the new one and I'm good to go on the new version but while I've been experimenting with kickstart installs I've had a lot of experience lately with fresh installs
2016-02-01 14:28:45	[TK]D-Fender	check to make sure you've executed the command that actually copies it into place
2016-02-01 14:28:49	c0ldg0ld	that's what I thought as I cna't see any errors in the actual compile
2016-02-01 14:28:53	[TK]D-Fender	and do it manually if you have to
2016-02-01 14:29:03	[TK]D-Fender	this has nothing to do with compiling it
2016-02-01 14:29:07	c0ldg0ld	thx
2016-02-01 14:29:14	[TK]D-Fender	its a raw copy
2016-02-01 14:30:26	[TK]D-Fender	sh"make config" should do it IIRC
2016-02-01 14:30:47	[TK]D-Fender	Back up any configs you have just in case

2016-02-01 14:41:01	c0ldg0ld	the command I typed was "make config" nothing extra.  This is output from the command
2016-02-01 14:41:34	c0ldg0ld	that's all I've ever done to setup init scripts for both dahdi and Asterisk was a make config after compiling
2016-02-01 14:42:27	[TK]D-Fender	c0ldg0ld	make -C tools config <- this looked like you did otherwisse
2016-02-01 14:42:41	[TK]D-Fender	Check the docs again for what's required at that step
2016-02-01 14:42:42	c0ldg0ld	yes I know but that was part of the script.  not something I typed in
2016-02-01 14:42:53	c0ldg0ld	I have. it says the same thing you said

2016-02-01 14:43:55	c0ldg0ld	you can see the only input I did at the top and then what I pasted in here at the bottom
2016-02-01 14:45:50	c0ldg0ld	that part may not actually mean anything at all... it might just mean that there's no "config" script for the dahdi tools portion of the "complete" package which would be understandable.  I wouldn't think any of those tools would need to start at boot

2016-02-01 14:48:52	c0ldg0ld	from the kb, I'd always been told to install libpri first, would this make a diff?  I wouldn't think so...

2016-02-01 14:50:32	c0ldg0ld	I originally assumed (Since I was trying to use CentOS 7) that is was a "not ready for systemd" type thing

2016-02-01 14:57:12	mub	Let me figure out what I did
2016-02-01 14:57:55	c0ldg0ld	I've gotten it working several times on 7 before but it seems like every new install on 7 I run into new errors either with Ast or one of the support programs I used so I decided to stick with 6.x for now.
2016-02-01 15:00:11	c0ldg0ld	getting dahdi working has been so trivial in the past that the last few systems I rebuilt I didn't even realize I had an issue until I had everything configured and I tried to start making calls

2016-02-01 15:07:47	c0ldg0ld	actually running ldconfig fixed the library issue

2016-02-01 15:33:53	WIMPy	Last time they were available seperately.

2016-02-01 15:35:13	c0ldg0ld	it's been quite a while since I did that.  I remember running into a lot of issues and eventually got it workin but this is back around the time of the original pi's
2016-02-01 15:35:39	c0ldg0ld	and come to think of it, I didn't bother with dahdi because I couldn't get an interface card hooked up to rpi!

2016-02-01 16:49:42	waj	Quick question: does Asterisk have support for SRV records in pjsip?
2016-02-01 16:58:37	@file	13 has support for SRV records, master (what will become 14) has superior support which includes NAPTR and failover
2016-02-01 16:58:41	 *	WIMPy still wonders what happened there...

2016-02-01 17:00:04	waj	file: I'm using 13, but I can see it's not requesting SRV records. Just looking for A and AAAA instead.
2016-02-01 17:00:32	@file	what is the URI you are dialing?
2016-02-01 17:02:26	waj	No... I'm just setting up a sip trunk. Here is my config: https://gist.github.com/waj/27c901d99c4a334a5641
2016-02-01 17:03:15	waj	And when I run `pjsip show identify callcentric` I can see it has the A records, but not the SRV ones
2016-02-01 17:03:57	waj	And that seems to lead to random incoming call rejections when the call comes from some of the servers listed as SRV but not A
2016-02-01 17:04:43	@file	the type=identify section does not use SRV at this time
2016-02-01 17:05:41	@file	you can potentially use the line functionality though, there's a blog post at https://www.asterisk-blog.com/ about it

2016-02-01 19:44:36	klow	nope I just have 2 soft phones and I'm sitting here at home
2016-02-01 19:44:41	klow	on on my iPhone and one on my macbook
2016-02-01 19:44:47	klow	and my server is at my data center

2016-02-01 19:45:38	Get_The_Fish	klow: Also, NAT. It makes babies cry. So that is the issue. Disable STUN, TURN, ICE or whatever NAT traversal methods that may be enabled in Bria.
2016-02-01 19:46:24	klow	Indeed NAT sucks.  Unfortunately my task here is to set up a PBX for people roaming around god knows where with Bria on their iPhones
2016-02-01 19:46:34	klow	and I have to sort it eventually to deal with NAT as best as humanly possible

2016-02-01 19:47:05	Get_The_Fish	klow: So since you are on the same LAN, we shouldnt be seeing IP addresses like we see on line 3
2016-02-01 19:48:37	klow	sorry I should clarify - my 2 phones are here on my LAN at home,  my server is collocated .
2016-02-01 19:49:00	klow	making it more confusing - my home router is VPN split tunnel, so I can also connect to the LAN ip of the PBX if needed
2016-02-01 19:49:01	Get_The_Fish	klow: yeah ok that changes things quite a bit!
2016-02-01 19:49:13	klow	and I have been switching back and forth in my testing so even I don't know what I did in that call heh

2016-02-01 20:51:16	djiboutiii	Hello - I had a question about RTP packets.
2016-02-01 20:52:02	djiboutiii	I have an asterisk server. When I call it, listen to the menu options (RTP working at this point), and then I dial an extension. The extension is simply forwarding the call to a cell phone.
2016-02-01 20:52:12	djiboutiii	However, there is no audio when the call is done.
2016-02-01 20:52:19	djiboutiii	call is answered*
2016-02-01 20:52:31	djiboutiii	There is no NAT here, it's a public facing machine.
2016-02-01 20:52:43	djiboutiii	Nothing else has changed, this worked for 3 years.
2016-02-01 20:52:54	djiboutiii	Only package updates have taken place
2016-02-01 20:53:09	<--	mjordan (mjordan@nat/digium/x-rsstpdgwevddskef) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-01 20:53:20	djiboutiii	With rtp debug on, I can see packets being sent from asterisk to two IP's
2016-02-01 20:53:26	djiboutiii	There are no packets received.
2016-02-01 20:53:44	djiboutiii	Does that seem odd to have rtp packets sending to two ip's?
2016-02-01 20:54:01	@newtonr	Check the SDP we sent to the far end to see where we ask them to send audio back
2016-02-01 20:54:09	@newtonr	Maybe you are looking at RTP for two different calls
2016-02-01 20:54:15	djiboutiii	Hey, sorry. Lacking in my terminology. What's SDP?
2016-02-01 20:54:58	djiboutiii	And that's a good point about 2 calls, though this is a closed test so it would only be a symptom of my issue
2016-02-01 20:56:29	djiboutiii	newtonr: If you don't mind, could you tell me how to check SDP?
2016-02-01 20:57:23	@newtonr	Nope, that sorta goes beyond the discussion here - I'll find an article or guide that explains it though. One minute
2016-02-01 20:57:42	@newtonr	https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/113271/understanding-sip-traces

2016-02-01 20:59:56	@newtonr	djiboutiii, Mostly I don't have the time. If I did I'd be glad to dive into SIP and SDP. :)  Pay particular attention to reading about the "c=" parameter within the SDP and how that relates to where the audio streams end up getting sent
2016-02-01 21:01:32	djiboutiii	newtonr: Oh i wouldn't expect you to dedicate much time. This is perfect, I can hopefully narrow down my issue or at least ask a more targeted question.
2016-02-01 21:01:41	@newtonr	djiboutiii, in addition this article goes into RTP stream analysis with wireshark as well http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9398
2016-02-01 21:01:56	djiboutiii	Nice - that's what I've been staring at
2016-02-01 21:02:14	@newtonr	Yeah if you go that route you'll make a lot of progress
2016-02-01 21:03:39	@newtonr	In the meantime if you pastebin logs of the call  (https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Collecting+Debug+Information) then someone may be able to look through that and help
2016-02-01 21:04:48	djiboutiii	Sounds good. I'll take a crack at it first, I have some good logs (using that link) already so this first link you sent is really informative.
2016-02-01 21:04:53	djiboutiii	And ty again.

2016-02-01 21:36:14	djiboutiii	Interesting... and odd.
2016-02-01 21:38:17	djiboutiii	Seems like it communicates with that IP until the forwarded call is dialed and answered. Then talks with that IP again after the call ends
