Given you just want a unique file name, I believe a full class to do that is overkill - you should be able to accomplish it with a method (and avoid the current issue by using that as the decorator instead).

2015-12-29 14:48:49	Woomla	I've just installed python 3.5 64bit for windows in a separate folder. Previously I used 3.4. Now when I run pytest in 3.4, I get a ValueError: bad marshal data (set size out of range). Did the 3.5 installation break the 3.4 installation?

2015-12-29 15:22:30	guyman20	I'm programming on python for years now, but have never used Django and don't really understand what it is. I've wrote a lot of "normal" python code that manipulates a database and I'm looking for a way to deploy this code to the web. Everything I found (Modulus, OpenShift) seems to be suitable only for Django-like projects. I really need a service that will let me deploy a simple code, and that also have mongoDB integrated with it.

2015-12-29 15:24:24	ChrisWarrick	guyman20: You can’t just expose an app to the web. You need to adjust it somehow and teach it how the web works and how to talk to it.  In order to do that, you must use a web framework.  Django is one of them, Flask is another.

2015-12-29 15:25:44	ChrisWarrick	guyman20: If you are using MongoDB (which I don’t think you should, but that’s a different conversation), you might not want Django or anything else that integrates sensible (i.e. relational) database support.  Flask is supported at some PaaS platforms (eg. Heroku).  And, of course, you can run EVERYTHING on a VPS.

2015-12-29 18:09:25	jleclanche	capu: frameworks are all super abstracted from how web apps actually learn, so there's a lot of knowledge you will not be able to port between the frameworks regardless of which one you choose

2015-12-29 18:16:18	_habnabit	borisj, no. the problem with flask is that @app.route mutates 'app'. pyramid's view registration doesn't mutate anything except attributes on the decorated function
2015-12-29 18:16:28	JavaLover	but thx _habnabit it's people like you who make coding a great experience :D
2015-12-29 18:16:30	jleclanche	capu: absolutely. flask is a good fit for that. just keep in mind that if you have bigger plans, you'll probably want to look into django. they are both easy to learn, django just has a lot more batteries included

2015-12-29 18:17:36	_habnabit	borisj, that's not what i said. the methods on a configurator mutate the configurator, but you don't decorate routes with a configurator
2015-12-29 18:17:39	JavaLover	heyyyy Galdemore we in the same page
2015-12-29 18:17:42	_habnabit	JavaLover, i have a bitcoin address
2015-12-29 18:17:48	JavaLover	hahahaa <3
2015-12-29 18:17:49	Galdemore	but when I run the .py it says "No Ident response"

2015-12-29 18:18:11	JavaLover	Galdemore which bot are you using?
2015-12-29 18:18:43	_habnabit	borisj, with pyramid, you tell it what package your views live in, and it looks for any functions that are annotated as a view
2015-12-29 18:18:45	JavaLover	How does your bot ping & say hello, if you're not running the python script yet?
2015-12-29 18:18:53	Galdemore	I made one
2015-12-29 18:18:56	_habnabit	borisj, there's more sophisticated filtering possible, but that's the general idea
2015-12-29 18:19:06	Galdemore	I am running the script
2015-12-29 18:19:07	JavaLover	is it a hexchat plugin version, or is it a stand alone?
2015-12-29 18:19:09	borisj	eww, well, that’s one approach, I guess
2015-12-29 18:19:20	_habnabit	borisj, it's the only sane approach
2015-12-29 18:19:22	morissette	IS uuid4() feasible as a hash key for a dynamodb table? (I did read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates)

2015-12-29 18:19:25	JavaLover	like when you run it, you say python mybot.py ?
2015-12-29 18:19:30	Galdemore	it's stand alone? I'm running it in powershell

2015-12-29 18:19:35	JavaLover	oh okay good
2015-12-29 18:19:36	Galdemore	I say python bottest.py
2015-12-29 18:19:42	_habnabit	borisj, mutating the app at import time requires the app to _exist_ at import time, which leads to circular dependency problems
2015-12-29 18:19:47	JavaLover	right so...you can ping it to say hello then?
2015-12-29 18:19:54	Galdemore	no it won't connect it says
2015-12-29 18:19:58	Galdemore	"No ident response"
2015-12-29 18:20:01	JavaLover	do you have the right addressS?

2015-12-29 18:20:22	JavaLover	well I just ran a test to make that situation
2015-12-29 18:20:31	JavaLover	and i'm using twistedbot and for me the error i get is "unknown endpoint type"
2015-12-29 18:20:34	Galdemore	are either of these wrong
2015-12-29 18:20:34	_habnabit	borisj, it's better to remove the requirement entirely, and just scan for views when you need to. it even means you can make a testing app that contains only a subset of your views
2015-12-29 18:20:36	JavaLover	so you probably do have the right address
2015-12-29 18:20:36	Galdemore	ircsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
2015-12-29 18:20:36	Galdemore	ircsock.connect((server, 6667))
2015-12-29 18:20:39	Galdemore	sorry sorry
2015-12-29 18:20:45	JavaLover	can you see if the bot is connected to your channel?
2015-12-29 18:20:46	_habnabit	Galdemore, 'no ident response' is not an error
2015-12-29 18:20:50	Galdemore	oh
2015-12-29 18:20:56	borisj	_habnabit: Blueprints are designed to avoid this problem
2015-12-29 18:20:58	_habnabit	Galdemore, but the problem is that you're following a horrible, horrible tutorial

2015-12-29 22:12:11	_habnabit	Soni, can i suggest "don't use C"?

I add some I'm changing in different parts of code but most of them I let die after a method finishes. Tkinter has its own way of tracking widgets you use and they don't dissapear just because you don't reference them anymore

So in your GUI __init__ you will have self.parent=root because that can give you a lot of info on how to center windows you create etc... As for your layout, you're creating several frames, in methods called i.e. initLayout, I don't particularly see the need to send root to initLayout because inside initLayout you can just do self.parent

2015-12-29 23:27:09	jayjo	I should be more clear with the problem at hand.. I want to perform data calculations on user data that I don't want to store. I thought about putting them into a google sheet or an ms excel sheet, and then either reading the data from the sheet or calling python scripts on certain cells. I then thought about using a tkinter application that had the user save their data on their local machine. Those both see

2015-12-30 08:23:17	[Tritium]	DarkElf73: it would have been noticed sooner with the actuall traceback.  notice its __getitem__, not __get__.  I was looking for problems with descriptors when i should have been looking for indexing
2015-12-30 08:23:17	KirkMcDonald	WeiJunLi: Also the traceback is calling something called codeFile, but the code defines code_file...
2015-12-30 08:24:26	KirkMcDonald	WeiJunLi: All that said. Your decorator does not handle the 'self' argument properly.
2015-12-30 08:24:37	WeiJunLi	that's the only thing I have changed func names with uppercases but it still remains the same bsesides that

2016-01-26 14:32:15	gabmus	hello people, I'm back again from my unstable connection. I did some research and I found out that *there is no python module to apply a patch in pure python*. So I tought I could just be incorporating GNU diff and patch into my project. Now, I think there is a proper way of doing this rather then using the os.system() function. how would you do this? is using os.system() just fine? thanks

I just built tensorflow and that downloaded lots of other repos from the repo I had downloaded during build. So what you get totally depends on the time you start the build, not when you got the sources.
2016-01-27 10:05:19	nedbat	barneygale: it's broken if some don't define it.
2016-01-27 10:05:30	nedbat	barneygale: and i'm not sure it's breadth first

2016-01-27 10:07:08	sobukus	nedbat: You think, though, that pip folks would be open to the suggestion of doing the version check only when you actually want to install something? CPAN does it like that, methings.

Several python threads might set a global flag "ready" = True when any of them detects readiness, which causes the main thread to run (main() loops while not ready). A safety = RLock() protects writings in all threads, but do I need also to lock "safety" in main() knowing that it's only a consumer, not a writer, and that a True flag is True forever?

2016-01-27 14:37:12	henbruas	'm' or 'M' is a boolean expression that evaluates to True, because both sides are what we call truthy

2016-01-27 16:20:13	foo	I'm migrating an app from php to python, it's a chatbot type app. In the chatbot, I defined all the language like this: https://bpaste.net/show/3ff7c28b7944 - for this specific language, I took a random variation of $language['intro']['hello'] and used that. Along with this block of language are some settings (defined with 'default'). I'm looking at migrating this to python in a way that makes the most sense.

2016-01-27 17:02:47	runciter	rpkilby: if you dig into setuptools and look at the install command, it calls into the easy_install command, whereas pip has its own implementation: https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/8.0.2/pip/commands/install.py
2016-01-27 17:03:04	pickandmix	Hi guys, I need some advice on this code http://codepad.org/p43o7vw6
2016-01-27 17:03:06	Schwarzbaer	Hi. When implementing a dict-like class, what class should I inherit from, and which methods will I have to overwrite?

2016-01-27 17:03:34	pickandmix	Basically from line 15 to 50, I don't really understand how it's working. I understand it's doing a binary search.
2016-01-27 17:03:38	papna	Schwarzbaer: the collections module tells you the necessary methods to define.
2016-01-27 17:03:52	Schwarzbaer	Thanks.
2016-01-27 17:03:59	anth0ny	papna: hmm... so what would that be in this case? It seems easier to just put things in the queue, wait for the queue to be emptied, then stop the workers.  (Rather than having the workers query how many images are left in the DB or soemthing like that)
2016-01-27 17:04:02	runciter	rpkilby: tracing through what *that* imports, pip.req.req_set constructs setuptools requirements itself, instead of using Requirement.parse

I have been looking at slice, islice, split and so on, but all I find is how to do if you know exactly how many elements you need, but since paths and filenames aren't constant it's hard to know how many elements there is to get.

2016-01-28 14:56:59	ProjectH	I'm guessing the Free plan will work for me, or will it also have similar restrictions to a shared hosting?

I want to persist some parameters of these Fsm objects to a database. I am using SQLAlchemy and I created a declarative class called FsmDB. However, now I have to update FsmDB whenever Fsm changes. Can I not derive Fsm from SQLAlchemy's Declarative Base class?

If people need to use their objects as keys, and they need to check equality by something other than identity, then they will define __hash__.  otherwise they wont bother, because it can be a little counter-intuitive to do

2016-01-28 15:54:16	Grievre	[Tritium]: I guess it depends on what you class as "really a problem". If two objects have __hash__ and __eq__ defined such that the rule is violated, AND both methods are actually invoked in a way that makes it clear the rule is violated, I think that's a problem even if it doesn't result in actual undesired behavior /right now/
2016-01-28 15:54:23	Grievre	because it could in the future

2016-01-29 20:47:49	AlexMax	Hello.  I'm writing a file parser, trying to figure out why it is so slow.  Through my use of ctrl-c profiling, I am finding that 4 times out of 5, I am killing the parser inside of re.match.  Would I be better off rewriting my parser without the use of regular expressions?  I've read some documentation that leads me to believe that it would be a waste of time since the regex engine is in C.

2016-02-01 14:30:16	rdnt	tos9, the current and parent dir are packages
2016-02-01 14:30:18	ashishjain	tos9: how are templates used in python, say a json template
2016-02-01 14:30:25	tos9	ashishjain: If you have no other preference, use install_package_data=True in your setup.py

2016-02-01 14:31:00	tos9	ashishjain: They'll get installed into your package, and then you can refer to them by doing e.g. import mypackage.static; os.path.join(os.path.dirname(mypackage.static.__file__), "foo.json")
2016-02-01 14:31:23	ashishjain	tos9: that is indeed a json file

2016-02-01 14:31:33	tos9	rigid: So, one way of explaining the issue is this: when you use inheritance, the tools available to you in your programming languages are exactly those provided within the inheritance toolkit
2016-02-01 14:31:52	altendky	tos9: thanks for that. I should tidy mine up to use the package

2016-02-01 14:32:19	tos9	rigid: one very minor problem here by the way is that in most langauges, not including Python, lots of those tools suck

2016-02-01 14:32:48	tos9	rigid: Python happens to have an implementation of multiple inheritance with proper semantics for call-once (via super()) -- many many other languages don't

2016-02-01 14:41:33	rigid	tos9: yeah, i saw that multiple inheritance "just works as expected" (in my case), so I used it. Sure you have the entire toolkit of the language, but isn't it basically a "workaround to achieve inheritance by using convention instead of language"? That sounds a lot like C to me (which isn't a bad thing for me, but it sounds like the opposite of how one reasoned for high-level languages in the 90s and that the OOP principle failed in a way)
2016-02-01 14:41:33	rigid	yes makes perfect sense. But for the "why": that assumes that multiple inheritance failed? I think I did the same with inheritance but only using 3 classes instead of 9.

2016-02-01 17:21:46	granden	Hi all! I'm having the question everyone have when starting with a new language I guess. Which framework should I use :)  The reason I feel I should ask is not that I want a definite answer, because I dont think there is one, but my project shall be a SAAS app, and I have not been able to find any got comparision or reviews regarding building saas in python.  So anyone who have some recommendations?
2016-02-01 17:21:52	eevee	if you want to capture a stack trace, you can only do it while the error is happening, not afterwards — but you can assign a function to $SIG{__DIE__} which will be called when `die` happens, and that can capture a stack trace and put it somewhere.  usually you bundle the error and stack trace together in some object and assign that to $@
2016-02-01 17:22:00	eevee	%SIG is a superglobal dict of signal handlers, of course
2016-02-01 17:22:04	rweir	granden, do you mean "web framework"
2016-02-01 17:22:16	granden	Oh, yeah sorry for not specifying that.

2016-02-01 17:23:13	eevee	you can't "load" an exception system

2016-02-01 17:27:52	linelevel	Hi, this might not be the right channel to ask, but I'm looking for advice on what pattern to use for my data: some mix of pure python classes and SqlAlchemy models. Basically, I have to store a record in my db for each object of type `Thing`. `Thing`s have types, so I'd also like a ForeignKey to a `ThingType` model. The problem is that each ThingType has data associated with it that cannot be stored in the db.
2016-02-01 17:28:03	linelevel	In particular, each ThingType needs to implement its own `is_valid_thing` method... this would suggest that I should have a python base class called BaseThing and implement a subclass for each ThingType.. but that doesn't work well with storing Things in the db.
2016-02-01 17:28:03	sartan	speaking of the topic I think i just stepped into a really well timed question. i should be looking into rabbitmq myself.
2016-02-01 17:28:05	rweir	granden, if you are going to get handle any sort of success you need to be able to scale horizontally
2016-02-01 17:28:13	linelevel	The only thing I can think of is to do both and then have a big `if` statement in `Thing.is_valid()` that calls the right methodbased on the type.. but that seems dirty. This seems like it must be a fairly common problem, any suggestions?

2016-02-02 04:13:49	simpson	Specifically, in the sense that, in Java, `this` is magically referent for the current object. In Python, `self` is explicitly bound, and objects are actually dictionaries. In Monte, object names are part of the object closure, so exactly the same syntax is used for static/class/instance methods.
