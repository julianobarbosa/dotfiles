2016-01-26 14:29:51	jtreminio	may not be an error but it's not valid for the pluin
2016-01-26 14:29:56	jnap	for the merge to happen
2016-01-26 14:30:04	jtreminio	needs separate lines, no comma?

2016-01-28 07:21:16	noregret	yeah
2016-01-28 07:21:16	emrysal	so all stuff is local or you can easily re-provision.... right?

2016-01-28 07:21:54	noregret	not really
2016-01-28 07:22:10	noregret	but it took some time to set stuff up
2016-01-28 07:22:13	emrysal	ah :), I think in this case your box has been deleted by accident
2016-01-28 07:22:38	noregret	actually, i see in the VM dir .vbox-prev and .vbox-tmp
2016-01-28 07:22:45	emrysal	and I think in the future you should use either database migrations and setup to provision or a local instance on your dev?

2016-01-28 07:23:06	noregret	i don't get what happened
2016-01-28 07:23:29	emrysal	can be anything, vagrant doing something weird, vbox doing something weird
2016-01-28 07:23:43	noregret	there is one thing I don't do actually. I shutdown my pc without vagrant halt, could that be the issue ?
2016-01-28 07:24:17	emrysal	nah, that would only cause your vm to do an file system check the next vagrant up
2016-01-28 07:24:32	noregret	aha, so no need to shutdown the vm when turning off the pc
2016-01-28 07:24:32	emrysal	could corrupt your system - but not delete the file
2016-01-28 07:25:10	emrysal	well, it is possible that you corrupt your vagrant instance when you do that - but on the other hand, it's vagrant - if it's corrupt: reprovision
2016-01-28 07:25:27	emrysal	on production environments clean shutdowns are recommended though!

2016-01-28 07:28:11	noregret	yeah sure
2016-01-28 07:28:57	IcePic	if you cut the "power" to the vm, there is no real telling what may or may not happen to its internal view of the diskfile it uses as a harddrive.

2016-01-28 07:29:31	emrysal	yeah, I was about to link it to you :')
2016-01-28 07:29:38	IcePic	it could be updating some very crucial part of the meta-directory structure on the disk or something, even if is very unlikely.
2016-01-28 07:30:12	emrysal	I suppose if you turn off vbox mid-write, vbox doesn't like it
2016-01-28 07:30:34	noregret	i see
2016-01-28 07:30:42	noregret	so i should shutdown the vm first
2016-01-28 07:30:48	IcePic	if you want to keep it
2016-01-28 07:31:04	noregret	is it the halt command?
2016-01-28 07:31:13	IcePic	some peoples usecases for vagrant is to make re-provision as easy as starting up a cleanly shutdown machine
2016-01-28 07:31:44	emrysal	I've pretty much hammered on that part already, to noregret's annoyance :]

2016-01-28 14:15:19	electrofelix	wondering if anyone here is familiar with vagrants internals around how recover should work, I'm working on respecting the --no-destroy-on-error option for vagrant-libvirt
2016-01-28 14:15:52	electrofelix	and looking at the existing code at https://github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt/blob/master/lib/vagrant-libvirt/action/wait_till_up.rb#L77 seems like no matter what error occurs once it's one that is subclassed from the base class
2016-01-28 14:16:06	electrofelix	that the recover will always skip terminate
2016-01-28 14:16:33	electrofelix	which leaves me wondering as to where that is the right thing to be checking against in the first place?

The host is Windows 10, Cygwin with rsync and openssh installed. Vagrant 1.8.1 and the guest machine is Ubuntu.

2016-02-01 17:46:01	asampal	I'd like to work in a Linux guest on a Windows system. If I've set up the Linux VM to my liking, can I use Vagrant to just provision a few apps (e.g. Postgres, Redis, etc.)? Currently I'm using Vagrant from within Windows to provision to a headless Linux that is set up to run the services I mentioned, but I have my dev environment outside of that box. I'd like to change that.
2016-02-01 17:46:18	ada	i dont use homestead, skinux , you can see what 'homestead' does by doing 'which homestead'
2016-02-01 17:46:26	ada	it should return the path to an executable or the alias
2016-02-01 17:47:11	ada	asampal: you would use a shell script and vagrant shell-provisioner, or a puppet/ansible/chef cookbook and the appropriate provisioner
2016-02-01 17:48:26	ada	asampal: vagrant will bring up your box and then run your provisioning script.  shell support is always there, if you want to use puppet/ansible/chef you have to make sure the right software/dependencies are already installed in the box before you 'vagrant up
2016-02-01 17:48:56	skinux	Homestead appears to be a binary
2016-02-01 17:49:25	ada	does 'vagrant ssh' work?
2016-02-01 17:49:27	skinux	Either way, I know that homestead up DOES try to boot the VM
2016-02-01 17:51:34	ada	worst case scenario, bring the box up even tho ssh fails.  then bring up virtualbox, sign in through the vbox console, restart sshd with debugging on and in the foreground (not a daemon), then try reconnecting from your host OS with vagrant ssh or homested ssh and see what SSHD says
2016-02-01 17:52:00	asampal	<ada> can I be in and using my VM already when I have Vagrant provision the services? In other words, the lifetime of the provisioned services should be less than the lifetime of the VM, which I might have running most of the time I'd like to do the provisioning of the services
2016-02-01 17:52:36	ada	asampal: while your box is running, you can run 'vagrant provision' from your host and vagrant will attempt to run the provisioning step again
2016-02-01 17:52:42	ada	yes, you can do it on a box that is running
2016-02-01 17:53:03	ada	idk what you mean by 'lifetime or privisioned services'
2016-02-01 17:53:07	ada	of*

2016-02-01 17:53:31	ada	no
2016-02-01 17:53:37	ada	thats not how the provisioning step works
2016-02-01 17:54:37	ada	you can think of it as just "run this script after booting up"
2016-02-01 17:54:52	ada	and the script can be shell, puppet, ansible, chef, or powershell
2016-02-01 17:55:07	asampal	we're currently using saltscript
2016-02-01 17:55:18	ada	theres a salt provider too

2016-02-01 17:56:05	asampal	ada: you were asking me?
2016-02-01 17:56:09	ada	vagrant will still boot a machine even if ssh fails
2016-02-01 17:56:13	asampal	no, I see
2016-02-01 17:56:38	ada	open your vboxmanage gui and you should see the box running, skinux
2016-02-01 17:57:21	asampal	ada: why is it that the provisioning can only happen right after bootup of the VM?
2016-02-01 17:57:35	skinux	Well, homestead is running, but vagrant ssh says it isn't.
2016-02-01 17:57:35	ada	thats just how vagrant works

2016-02-01 17:58:19	asampal	ada: what do you mean?
2016-02-01 17:58:21	ada	you can re-run provisioning at any time by doing 'vagrant provision' on your host
2016-02-01 17:58:27	ada	but its just going to run your script again
2016-02-01 17:58:51	asampal	ada: and if I do a 'vagrant halt' that would bring down the VM as well?
2016-02-01 17:58:55	ada	yes
2016-02-01 17:59:13	asampal	there's no way to 'de-provision'?
2016-02-01 17:59:34	ada	no
2016-02-01 18:00:01	ada	vagrant destroy && vagrant up;  there's your de-provision
2016-02-01 18:00:30	asampal	ada: sure, but I want to remain in the VM after services come down
2016-02-01 18:00:37	ada	vagrant is not a service management / config management layer, it only brings VMS up and down
2016-02-01 18:00:57	asampal	ada: should I be looking at Docker instead, for this need?
2016-02-01 18:01:07	ada	i dont know, docker is completely different
2016-02-01 18:01:27	ada	docker is not virtualization, so if all you need is to bring a service up and down at will, docker might work
