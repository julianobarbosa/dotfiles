2016-01-27 12:59:33	geeMc	Hmm, has anyone seen external checks that become unsupported for (allegedly) not reason? They recover a couple of seconds (perhaps a minute) after, but it causes some triggers to go off. Zabbix 2.4.7 with 3-node galera mysql setup and the servers/services in question have no problems at all. Also, the script works just fine when executing it on the zabbix server, with both root and zabbix user. Shouldn't be a timeout issue (even if I hammer
2016-01-27 12:59:34	geeMc	the script about 100 times, all requests are taken care of in miliseconds.)

I don't want to do a new setup of a terrible product. are there any marketing materials that show feature set / comparisons with big name products?

2016-01-27 14:14:30	Richlv	Parabola, zabbix usually does not do it because it does not lead to very honest or accurate materials. but do contact sales@zabbix.com, they might help you with something. maybe arrange a demo for your management :)

2016-01-28 12:19:04	Gambit15	SirLagz, the expression field is greyed out unless I'm on the template itself
2016-01-28 12:19:32	SirLagz	Gambit15: ah...
2016-01-28 12:20:33	Gambit15	For example, the template raises a trigger when the server's disk is at 90%. For this particular server, I'd like it to be 5%. There're other scenarios where I've wanted to make a slight tweak to a particular host's triggers also
2016-01-28 12:20:54	Gambit15	Just wandering if the only way is to manually create a completely new trigger

2016-01-28 12:46:46	whosgonna	and you want to have that for each host group
2016-01-28 12:47:04	whosgonna	the hostgroup can be a variable you select in a drop down menu as you view it

Should I set a dependancy on the informational trigger to the average trigger?

2016-01-28 14:45:58	timdau	so, I know just about nothing about vcenter or esx or vmware.  But when I login, one of them has a little warning icon, but the rest don't
2016-01-28 14:46:30	timdau	And the warning appears to be that ESXi shell and SSH have been enabled.  So nothing to worry about.

2016-01-28 14:46:39	whosgonna	That would explain why you have an esx status of red on tht system.
2016-01-28 14:46:49	whosgonna	you can reset those alarms, iirc.

2016-01-28 14:47:15	whosgonna	your questions are more about vmware than zabbix or vmbix, though.  vmbix should reflect what you see in vcenter.
2016-01-28 14:47:48	timdau	I don't think that is correct.  The other 6 nodes are also "Red" and there is no error or warning in vsphere for them.

2016-01-28 14:49:39	whosgonna	what do you get if you query from the shell.  it should be like:

2016-01-28 14:50:25	whosgonna	timdau, esx.status is reflecting the way that vcenter displays alarm.  it displays "is the host in alarm", not "the host is in X alarm"
2016-01-28 14:50:48	timdau	But there is no alarm in vcenter
2016-01-28 14:50:50	whosgonna	ok, and is vmbix pointing at vcenter, or an individual esxihost?
2016-01-28 14:50:59	whosgonna	what do you get for:

2016-01-28 14:51:14	timdau	a few hours ago I changed it from individual to vcenter

2016-01-28 14:51:36	whosgonna	returned by esxi.status
2016-01-28 14:51:55	whosgonna	so, is your $hostname in  esx.status[$hostname]
2016-01-28 14:52:02	whosgonna	match exactly the hostname as it displays in vcenter?
2016-01-28 14:52:23	whosgonna	in otherwords, if your hostname in vcenter displays as "esxi-001.domain.com"
2016-01-28 14:52:31	timdau	if I use the IP it gets"1"
2016-01-28 14:52:42	whosgonna	and you do esx.status[esxi-001] then it will return 32
2016-01-28 14:52:46	timdau	maybe I should be deleting the old hosts.
2016-01-28 14:52:52	whosgonna	what is the hostname as it apperas in vcenter when you view the hosts?
2016-01-28 14:53:08	timdau	in vcenter its not the hostname its the IP address
2016-01-28 14:53:23	whosgonna	not hostname, but the "name of the host" -to differentiate from something like running `hostname` in the esxshell
2016-01-28 14:53:54	whosgonna	if the name assigned to the host in vcenter is the IP address, then when you query vmbix for information about that host, that is the name you will need to use.
2016-01-28 14:54:46	timdau	okay, so I am going to delete these hosts.
2016-01-28 14:55:11	timdau	and the template should re-create them
2016-01-28 14:55:17	whosgonna	vmbix is just passing the query to the vcenter sdk.  If you ask the sdk "what is the status of esxi-001?", and it doesn't have a host with a name of esxi-001, it will tell you, "i can't find that host.  if it should be there, that's a bad thing"

2016-01-28 14:56:56	timdau	if there are more things I would presumably add them to the template.  All of the hosts should be the same.

2016-01-28 15:04:32	whosgonna	you may still want some discovery rules.  if  you have multple drives assigned to the vm for example
2016-01-28 15:05:30	whosgonna	or you want to get CPU utilization per core, an LLD would be good to populate the individual items
2016-01-28 15:05:30	whosgonna	my vmbix instance was installed origianlly before the module, but it had a template called "Template VmBix VM with wrapper"
2016-01-28 15:05:46	whosgonna	the "wrapper" doesn't exist anymore (that's what the loadable module replaces), but i would guess there's still a similar template.
2016-01-28 15:06:25	timdau	so the ESX Hosts re-appeared with the IP address now.
2016-01-28 15:06:38	timdau	and it "resolved" the Red error

2016-01-28 15:40:04	LarryD	But then, the entire permissions structure is nearly unusable and should be rebuilt from scratch IMHO.
2016-01-28 15:40:04	LzrdKing	thats smart
2016-01-28 15:40:07	opensourcegeek	what is ns in that sample json? 
2016-01-28 15:40:19	LzrdKing	i find it useable enough, so far
2016-01-28 15:41:00	LarryD	I find that it isn't granular enough...  If you create an action that references a template then the user has to have full read/write to that template or they won't be able to see the action.
2016-01-28 15:41:13	bluestrain	Hello,   I'm getting false alarms for the files system discovery rules from Template OS Linux.   I've tried to add a regex and updated the rules, but I'm still getting the false alarms.   What should I do to debug this?

2016-01-28 15:41:27	LarryD	So I have to choose between giving them too much access or too little.  There is no goldilocks zone.
2016-01-28 15:41:36	LzrdKing	how do you know they are false?
2016-01-28 15:41:45	LzrdKing	bluestrain: ^
2016-01-28 15:41:47	Akinari	And you need to add them to read access for emails

2016-01-28 15:42:43	LarryD	In my case the permissions get even more complex because alerts are not sent to individuals... they are sent to dummy users that represent a group in a 3rd party alerting service.
2016-01-28 15:42:58	bluestrain	LzrdKing: The are snapsot files example /sa/.snapshot/weekly.2016-01-03_0015

2016-01-29 15:55:15	opensourcegeek	when I use proxy protocol to send custom data the server just responds with a OK message, I cannot see any errors in server log either

2016-01-29 16:02:59	Richlv	sid_zabbix, not easily
2016-01-29 16:03:47	Richlv	opensourcegeek, but "ok" does not sound like an error - what's the actual problem ? :)
2016-01-29 16:04:00	Richlv	sid_zabbix, it depends on what is used in the template etc
2016-01-29 16:04:10	Richlv	sid_zabbix, why do you need it ?
2016-01-29 16:05:28	racooper	what's EOL for Zabbix 1.8 anyway? I'd think it would be about time to plan an upgrade...
2016-01-29 16:06:09	ccooke	I thought it was EOL ages ago
2016-01-29 16:06:23	sid_zabbix	this is the template I want to use

2016-01-29 16:06:39	opensourcegeek	Richlv - I cannot see the data I set to for the item key, and also according to https://www.zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/protocols/zabbix_proxy/2.0 it should return a response object? - I'm using "Sending historical data" example by the way
2016-01-29 16:07:03	Richlv	1.8 is not supported anymore since november 2014 or so :)
2016-01-29 16:08:47	Richlv	opensourcegeek, i suspect it might need the zabbix header then
2016-01-29 16:08:57	Richlv	assuming your json is correct

2016-02-01 11:56:28	SirLagz	CyberJacob: right
2016-02-01 11:57:03	SirLagz	CyberJacob: well then you could just run Zabbix with a whitelist to only allow Pushover to access Zabbix
2016-02-01 11:57:06	CyberJacob	SirLagz: However for the API call to be made, firewall ports would have to be opened. Hence why I wanted to check how secure it would be to open said ports

2016-02-01 14:05:06	bildz	What is the best way to configure alerting where specific groups receive notifications for only a subset of alerts.  For example, database team receives notifications for CPU/Mem/Disk IO on only DB servers, Network team receives notifications for switchports going up/down, errors on interfaces, and server admins get alerts for only servers.

2016-02-01 14:15:34	whosgonna	yeah, it would be nicer if you could assign applications to triggers as well, but that's how i currently tackle that.
2016-02-01 14:16:12	whosgonna	pbbunny, for your graph question, are the graphs from templates that the user might not have permissions to?

2016-02-01 18:32:29	Richlv	kelv, it can very negatively impact other things. consider a) making the script faster; b) making it active check and increasing agent timeout only; c) using zabbix_sender for that

2016-02-02 05:24:49	Lauer	pygo_, new relic is better  :)
2016-02-02 05:25:05	Lauer	But you can add some monitoring to zabbix
2016-02-02 05:27:59	pygo_	Just checked new relic.Its a commercial prouduct like AppDynamics
2016-02-02 05:28:54	pygo_	Laurer:In your opinion what best can we achieve with zabbix for application monitoring?
2016-02-02 05:29:18	volter	pygo_: Can you be a bit more concrete about what "application monitoring" means?
2016-02-02 05:30:59	pygo_	Our prouduct is based on SOA.So we have a lot of services to monitor like rabbitmq,zookeper,some dbs and other service VM's
2016-02-02 05:33:06	volter	And what about them do you monitor?
2016-02-02 05:33:42	volter	That's to say, Zabbix doesn't come with many application-specific tests.
2016-02-02 05:33:51	volter	This doesn't mean that you can't use any.
2016-02-02 05:34:59	pygo_	I believe process level monitoring is there.A more drilled down version to find application performance lags or its cause.Can that also be done?
2016-02-02 05:35:48	pygo_	I still need to learn a lot about zabbix.Its still in an early phase.But just wanted to get a basic idea to start with
2016-02-02 05:35:51	volter	Consider Zabbix as a mechanism to retrieve, act upon and store data.
2016-02-02 05:36:22	volter	By the way, share.zabbix.com has some templates.
2016-02-02 05:37:26	volter	There are also wrapper scripts around Nagios scripts for instance, so you can continue using these, for instance.
2016-02-02 05:37:57	volter	One major difference there is, that Zabbix basically accepts only one chunk of information per "item".
2016-02-02 05:38:53	volter	If you want to submit multiple pieces of data at once, the Zabbix sender protocoll is usually used.

2016-02-02 14:08:50	Davo524	which is what volter is saying, that the action is likely the part that is not working
2016-02-02 14:09:20	Davo524	looking at the zabbix docs it has a similar example and is showing "Linux" rather than "linux", I would suggest testing with that, if nothing else to rule it out

2016-02-03 23:37:15	ArtGravity	volter: Server has no PTR for the IPv6, but the IPv4 has a PTR
2016-02-03 23:37:25	ArtGravity	agent host has PTR for IPv4 & IPV6
2016-02-03 23:37:48	ArtGravity	A & AAAA records are valid for agent host and server host
2016-02-03 23:38:10	volter	It now depends on your settings.
2016-02-03 23:40:52	ArtGravity	My remote host has a grey Z while the Zabbix server has a green Z
2016-02-03 23:41:12	volter	These icons can be misleading.
2016-02-03 23:41:23	volter	Anyway, what kind of items did you configure for the host?
2016-02-03 23:41:30	ArtGravity	I can't add any templates to the agent
2016-02-03 23:41:34	ArtGravity	it fails when I try
2016-02-03 23:41:49	volter	Did you create an agent interface for that host in the frontend?
2016-02-03 23:42:10	ArtGravity	Is that under configuration/hosts ?
2016-02-03 23:42:15	volter	Yes
2016-02-03 23:42:44	ArtGravity	I have an entry for it there. I have the DNS host name of the agent host under agent interfaces
2016-02-03 23:43:04	ArtGravity	Hostname: remote.example.com
2016-02-03 23:43:06	volter	OK
2016-02-03 23:43:24	volter	So, maybe you added a template that requires a different kind of interface?
2016-02-03 23:43:25	ArtGravity	Agent interfaces IP adddress: blank DNS name: remote.example.com
2016-02-03 23:43:33	ArtGravity	Connect to: DNS
2016-02-03 23:43:40	ArtGravity	port 10050
2016-02-03 23:43:52	volter	Yes, that's all good.
2016-02-03 23:43:58	ArtGravity	It has no templates linked at present
2016-02-03 23:45:08	ArtGravity	During previous attempts to link templates, I was selecting all that I wanted at once
2016-02-03 23:45:26	volter	You probably picked one that is unsuitable.
2016-02-03 23:45:28	ArtGravity	I tried adding just the Linux OS template by itself this time and it applied it
2016-02-03 23:45:39	volter	As expected! :)
2016-02-03 23:45:53	ArtGravity	Avilability still has the grey Z, but the result seems better so far
2016-02-03 23:46:09	volter	I generally suggest to ignore this icon.
2016-02-03 23:46:37	ArtGravity	I left the page and returned and it is now green
2016-02-03 23:46:40	ArtGravity	Hooray!
2016-02-03 23:46:48	ArtGravity	I may be able to replace Monitor.us after all
2016-02-03 23:48:24	ArtGravity	Thank you, volter 
2016-02-03 23:48:36	volter	You are welcome!
2016-02-03 23:48:37	zabbix	I am Batman!
2016-02-03 23:49:24	volter	Hehe, it says "Trusted by Adobe" on their website. So is Zabbix too!
2016-02-03 23:50:32	ArtGravity	It looks like my attempt to add "Template App Zabbix Agent" was what it didn't like.

2016-02-03 23:52:22	ArtGravity	Zabbix reports NTP service is down
2016-02-03 23:52:39	ArtGravity	service ntp status reports NTP server is running.
2016-02-03 23:54:07	ArtGravity	It's probably trying to check NTP from the internet vs the local interface
