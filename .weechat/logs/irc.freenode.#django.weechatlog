2015-12-29 00:53:06	mattmcc	WSGI is pretty much ubiquitous when it comes to Python web apps, maintaining FastCGI support didn't make any sense.

2015-12-29 16:23:16	Kipe_	the issue is that I used to have a lot of data in my database, but I've migrated to saving the "static" data to CSV-like files, and now the postgresql consumes resources, which could be used elsewhere :P
2015-12-29 16:23:52	Kipe_	I'm running my system on Raspberry Pis etc, so all the unnecessary memory consumption is quite critical
2015-12-29 16:24:14	oaulakh	as you can see in line 16 i have make a httpresponse if it's goes right and saved data but why i am not getting response, instead it's jumping to lower loop where it redirects to same page at line 18

2015-12-29 18:24:35	stole	I want to perform a search by tags, meaning that a search with the tags ['tag1','tag2'] should only retrieve records that have both of those tags. So far I'm using filter(record__tags__in=taglist], which is the same as an OR statement.

2015-12-29 20:54:10	+apollo13	also sqlite has no data validation, so whatever worked in sqlite doesn't have to work on another db
2015-12-29 20:54:24	+apollo13	check the values with a standard mysql shell then?

2015-12-29 20:56:27	jMyles	fission6: threads share program state, which can be helpful.  However, threads, in most but not all circumstances, are bad at handling concurrent CPU-heavy operations.
2015-12-29 20:56:41	jMyles	(most == almost all)
2015-12-29 20:57:23	jMyles	The main reason to use separate processes is to let the OS handle (in a far, far better way) CPU management.  Contrary to popular belief, this is important even in single-core situations, but especially with multiple cores.
2015-12-29 20:57:26	fission6	i dont see how threads would help

2015-12-29 21:13:47	bryanp	haystack is the leaky abstraction?

2015-12-29 23:24:45	mattmcc	bcSquared: A custom user model means a different table, which means any relationships from other models have to change.

2015-12-29 23:28:54	karanlyons	There are?
2015-12-29 23:29:04	shangxiao	did you read the link that knbk pasted?
2015-12-29 23:29:09	karanlyons	It's just some custom migrations with hints passed to Django as to what you were doing.
2015-12-29 23:29:23	knbk	changing auth_user_model basically changes your complete migration history
2015-12-29 23:30:07	karanlyons	Ah yeah, cause its tied to apps. I was thinking custom model to custom model.
2015-12-29 23:30:55	karanlyons	Still, just remove the auth migration rows from the migrations table. If you want to be really cheeky, make *that* one of the migrations in your new app.
2015-12-29 23:31:13	knbk	if you change it, any FK thinks it is an FK to the new user model... you need to convince it that it's still pointing to the old user model
2015-12-29 23:31:38	karanlyons	So 001 is creating the new model in the new app, 002 is porting all the data, 003 is a bunch of raw SQL to port FKs and remove the auth_user rows from the migrations table.

Building the reverse migration won't be terribly fun, but not that much more difficult, just hardcode the auth_user rows in the reverse function.

2015-12-30 01:12:34	mattmcc	UserOfProducts: Well, which parts of the tutorial were unclear?
2015-12-30 01:13:14	oaulakh	mattmcc, and how i can check if user is exist in database? i did like SomeModel.objects.filter(somevalue).exist() is it right bcz it's throwing error too now
2015-12-30 01:13:29	UserOfProducts	i just felt the tutorial implies many of the functional relationships
2015-12-30 01:13:46	UserOfProducts	and im just following the instructions like a robot instead of really knowing what was going on
2015-12-30 01:13:49	oaulakh	fission6, how to use exists parameter to check if data exists in database

2015-12-30 01:16:27	mattmcc	UserOfProducts: For example..?  It's difficult to suggest alternate resources without having a better idea why this one seemed lacking.
2015-12-30 01:17:06	oaulakh	crispy is awesome i don't have to bootstrap things in details anymore :)
2015-12-30 01:17:11	UserOfProducts	i think its because this is my first time dealing with web frameworks

2015-12-30 05:03:48	markamodo_	no it redirects to a base page because the model's get absolute url method just returns the url of the base page.

2015-12-30 05:06:01	pembo13	depends on BASE_DIR i suppose

2015-12-30 05:08:05	mattmcc	So I would suggest, since you're already pointing nginx 'root' to /srv/project, also using /srv/project/static as your STATIC_ROOT, keeping it away from the Django project.

2015-12-30 06:51:15	mattmcc	But more to the point, validation that involves two fields should be done in the form-level clean method, not a field clean method.

2015-12-30 10:03:31	Mawuena	But D is just the id inside the response
2015-12-30 10:03:43	Mawuena	How can I get the full serialization of model D in the response ?
2015-12-30 10:04:13	Mawuena	What I do right now: models.A.objects.all().prefetch_related('B_set')
2015-12-30 10:04:26	av_	I have a small static site (generated from github.com/tripit/slate) and I want to serve this thing under endpoint `/docs/`. Can anyone tell me how do I go about it?
2015-12-30 10:04:46	Mawuena	@av_: Add the route in urls.py
2015-12-30 10:05:13	mattmcc	...Or let your web server handle it.
2015-12-30 10:05:27	mattmcc	If it's actually static, Django need not be involved.
2015-12-30 10:06:20	av_	mattmcc: yup, that the idea. so I need to write  nginx config?

2015-12-30 10:08:01	av_	yes
2015-12-30 10:08:54	mattmcc	So your existing configuration can probably serve as an example, if it handles static files.

2015-12-30 10:09:50	av_	Mawuena: yes, I think.. i was googling and found something similar
2015-12-30 10:10:00	Mawuena	That's what I have for my static files

2015-12-30 10:10:47	mattmcc	Nah, static is static.

2015-12-30 12:55:23	tompaw	What would be the most Django-stic approach to loggers in Model classes? My project uses a logger tree where all modules present themselves using logging.getLogger('proj_xxx.%s' % __name__) - and I was wondering if post_init on every Model class that (to initialize its self.logger for convenience and code readability) is the only way to do it.

2015-12-30 12:59:42	tompaw	The alternative being writing the full path every time: logging.getLogger('proj_xxx.%s' % __name__).info('#django channels takes a long time to respond')
2015-12-30 13:00:19	tompaw	Which is a pain compared to self.logger.warning('Answer already!')
2015-12-30 13:00:29	psychok7	hey there. is there an easy way to get the "old values" of a formset in django admin? i am only getting the new values and i need to keep the old ones for history
2015-12-30 13:01:19	tompaw	psychok7 My bet would be to use versioning in your Model, but I might be wrong.
2015-12-30 13:02:30	psychok7	tompaw: i am overring `save_formset` at the moment. would presignals solve it?
2015-12-30 13:02:42	psychok7	versioning like an app?

2015-12-30 13:03:29	tompaw	No, I had a similar situation and resolved it by simply adding version = models.IntegerField to my Model
2015-12-30 13:04:10	tompaw	you can then add a Model manager to pull the freshest data or do it manually .order_by('-version')
2015-12-30 13:04:26	tompaw	But again, that was a very primitive approach. But it works fine.
2015-12-30 13:05:27	psychok7	tompaw: i see. but if i am going to query the db i can just query the object before saving the update anyways. but i didnt want to waist db queries on this
2015-12-30 13:06:00	psychok7	i just need to log the information, more than needing to get back to it with versioning
2015-12-30 13:06:01	tompaw	wait. you need the history versions permanently (i.e. in your database), or just temporarily (session)?
2015-12-30 13:06:35	psychok7	tompaw:  just a log saying the price changed from x to y.. nothing fancy
2015-12-30 13:07:17	tompaw	psychok7 for logging, there are some specialized python tools that allow you to serialize and dump an object as a text/binary format. me - being a lazy ass - use json + logging

2015-12-30 13:07:59	tompaw	Simplejson actually, as json has issues with decimals and stuff.
2015-12-30 13:08:24	tompaw	then configure your logger to use syslog -> logstash -> kibana and bang, you're all sety.
2015-12-30 13:08:27	tompaw	set even.
2015-12-30 13:08:29	psychok7	 tompaw: that is not my isse. i can log fine. the prblem is that i dont have the old values to log anymore because save_formset updated the object and i dont want to make a db query before
2015-12-30 13:09:02	tompaw	You want to log old values without pulling them from DB? How's that supposed to work?
2015-12-30 13:09:18	psychok7	the request could bring the old values for example?
2015-12-30 13:10:05	tompaw	Wouldn't request store them in a session, which still uses some sort of storage server side, and effectively deliver a very similar performance?
2015-12-30 13:10:18	psychok7	tompaw: or even the initial that has that could have the value also

2015-12-30 13:30:43	psychok7	tompaw:  you could get the merchant_cnt value with django SUM  i think. and then maybe filter directly in the query the values that are `dice <= share`
2015-12-30 13:31:21	tompaw	psychok7 but in the DB these values would not increase, they'd be like A=30, B=30, C=40
2015-12-30 13:32:22	tompaw	so how would I filter it then?

2015-12-30 13:34:22	psychok7	 tompaw:  maybe something like ACHMerchant.objects.filter(out_enabled=1).filter(out_share__lte=dice = randint(1, merchant_cnt))
2015-12-30 13:35:15	psychok7	i am looking at your code sideways so hopefully it will give u ideas to use a better approvach
2015-12-30 13:35:18	tompaw	psychok7 I don't see how that would work, in DB all these shares overlap with each other.
2015-12-30 13:35:32	tomchristie	Unless you were denormalizing the values (eg -> A_THRESHOLD=30, B_THRESHOLD=60, C_THRESHOLD=100, and update those for everything anytime an instance is saved) I can't see how you'd be able to do this any better.
2015-12-30 13:36:28	tomchristie	Probably not a sensible plan, but if they we updated rarely, read often, and lookups were critical it might be sane.
2015-12-30 13:36:33	tompaw	tomchristie right, but then I'd have to update them every time I remove an object from the group. For instance, if I removed the first one, I'd have to update all the rest.
2015-12-30 13:36:42	tomchristie	Yes.
2015-12-30 13:37:00	tompaw	cool, that's what I thought, cheers.

Can someone give me a clue on what I broke? I think it's something really obvious but I just don't see it :) http://pastebin.com/pjiuA6W8

2015-12-30 15:43:28	fromishps	Hi, I am trying to upgrade a django installation from version 1.4 to 1.9. I have followed instructions re migrations, deleting the existing south migrations, and have run manage.py migrate for auth|contenttypes|admin|sessions|sites . Now when I try to run make migrations for any app, I get errors e.g. LookupError: App 'auth' doesn't have a 'group' model.
2015-12-30 15:43:28	django532	Quick (dumb) question: how is that some websites, for example, http://mysite.com can point to http://something.mysite.com ? is it another entirely different website, or is it another way of pointing to something like http://mysite.com/something ?
2015-12-30 15:43:35	psyferre	I'm assuming user sessions will still work fine and not collide since user ids will not be shared between the two apps, and I can still have relationships between users and objects in both applications.  When I eventually decommision the old application, the users will just login on the new app with no trouble... right?

2015-12-30 15:53:15	jaddison	fromishps, honestly, as painful as it sounds I would recommend following the upgrade guides from version to version - not a straight update from 1.4->1.9.
2015-12-30 15:53:20	efkin	o/
2015-12-30 15:53:22	jaddison	not fun, but...
2015-12-30 15:53:35	psyferre	django532: Look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain.  This isn't a django specific question, but:  a subdomain is setup in your DNS.  You could point it at an entirely different IP address, or at the same IP address as your domain.  If a different IP, then it's a different site.  If the same IP, then you could use your web server configuration to do a lot of different things.

2015-12-30 15:56:57	benbacardi	efkin: you can track changes to fields with something like FieldTracker http://django-model-utils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/utilities.html
2015-12-30 15:58:09	efkin	benbacard: thx! i'll check it out

2015-12-30 17:42:42	karanlyons	Technically .create() does return the object, so you *could* embed it into the call to Exercise.objects.create(), but that's not the most legible thing to do.

2015-12-30 17:48:37	karanlyons	Create the routine and bind it to a variable, and then reference that variable in the Exercise you create.
2015-12-30 17:48:55	karanlyons	creating the routine inside the create call to exercise is "clever" but not the good kind.

2015-12-30 18:23:20	karanlyons	nedbat: Basically, you get a contenttype made for every model (for permissions if you're using them), so when you remove a model the contenttypes with it go stale.

2016-01-04 08:49:12	schinckel	I've found that broad-spectrum caching helps reinforce bad programming practices: you are usually better off writing better algorithms/prefetch_/select_related
2016-01-04 08:49:58	blag	schinckel: so what I’m trying to do is basically let people configure which many-to-many models (the default ones) they want to cache, and that’s a hop, skip, and a jump away from allowing people to configure arbitrary models to cache

2016-01-26 14:19:10	+carljm	newdan: basically going from PendingDeprecationWarning to DeprecationWarning allows people to decide how much advance notice they want.

2016-01-26 14:19:46	Knyght	as for removing the string syntax, because it removes magic, makes dependencies more clear, and allows external tools the ability to analyse your code better. at least those are the benefits for me

2016-01-26 14:21:29	Knyght	JordiGH: that doesn't make improving consistency a bad thing, I think your argument is flawed. you're saying we shouldn't make things better
2016-01-26 14:21:53	JordiGH	Knyght: I'm saying queryset is not better enough to warrant breaking all the code that was calling it query_set.
2016-01-26 14:22:03	Knyght	I mean I'm all for not breaking APIs, but I think it's worth it over django being an unmaintainable mess with aliases everywhere
2016-01-26 14:22:03	+carljm	newdan: the reason Python chose to make PendingDeprecationWarning silent by default is so that developers (who know to do things like test with -Wall) can catch issues and fix them before end-users see them. Particularly for CLI tools like Mercurial where end-users might see a deprecation warning.

2016-01-26 15:15:06	TAsn	xBBTx, that is what I'm using at the moment, but how am I supposed to get the current object?

2016-01-26 15:15:20	tbaxter	admin actions are REALLY easy to write, and "export this" is a natural fit.

2016-01-26 15:15:34	TAsn	I currently just (hackishly) do something like: context['article']

2016-01-26 15:17:29	ivn	moldy, I don't want to export each row separately, I want to export whole table
2016-01-26 15:17:34	moldy	ivn: well, then you have to write the code. django-import-export doesn't do it for you.

2016-01-26 15:18:16	ivn	moldy, the answer i'm looking here is: Can that be done like that?
2016-01-26 15:18:19	TAsn	tbaxter, in the object, I have a field, let's call it "comment_set", and I want to modify the comments a bit (for example, number them)
2016-01-26 15:18:21	TAsn	before showing them
2016-01-26 15:18:24	moldy	ivn: sure
2016-01-26 15:18:30	TAsn	they are hierarchical
2016-01-26 15:18:36	blurkis	tbaxter: ah, ok.  And setting upload_to=something, changes from /media to the alternative?
2016-01-26 15:18:47	ivn	moldy, can I call (import-export) action through code and iterate through my queryset
2016-01-26 15:18:49	TAsn	so the numbering is 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 and etc.
2016-01-26 15:19:12	tbaxter	TAsn: I need to see the code. Just show us
2016-01-26 15:19:14	TAsn	so kind of involved, so I wanted to preprocess that before I pass it to the template. Adding more to the context felt like the right thing.
2016-01-26 15:19:17	TAsn	tbaxter, I don't have code
2016-01-26 15:19:27	tbaxter	You still haven't said anything that would involve get_context_data thought

2016-01-26 15:19:57	TAsn	tbaxter, how else would you implement this numbering?
2016-01-26 15:20:00	tbaxter	It's not get_context_data, because you already have object.comment_set

2016-01-26 15:20:33	TAsn	but I need to process it in python code before I can use it.
2016-01-26 15:20:39	ivn	moldy, actualy, I think that simplest solution would be this. (I implement my action to look exactly the same as import-export action) and tell it to perform that same action on every single object of my queryset
2016-01-26 15:20:40	TAsn	I don't want to put it in the model, because it's view specific
2016-01-26 15:20:41	tbaxter	TAsn: hard to say, given you've shown us no code, but I'd probably have it available on the comment object already. Worst case I'd iterate through object.comment_set and attach it.
2016-01-26 15:20:50	ivn	moldy, do you happened to know if that can be done that way?
2016-01-26 15:20:59	TAsn	tbaxter, the first: it's view specific, so a no go.
2016-01-26 15:21:05	moldy	ivn: sure
2016-01-26 15:21:15	tbaxter	ivn: go read the admin actions docs. I think you'll see how to do it pretty quickly
2016-01-26 15:21:18	TAsn	the second: you can't because the templating system is not powerful enough to deal with hierarchy.
2016-01-26 15:21:35	moldy	ivn: but i'd take a look at the django-import-export docs, because it most likely provides hooks where you can hook in your own function to generate the data...
2016-01-26 15:21:36	tbaxter	I didn't say anything about the templat

2016-01-26 15:24:46	tbaxter	Perhaps it should be a method on the object.. get_ordered_comments() or something like that
2016-01-26 15:24:48	TAsn	tbaxter, so maybe I'll just add it to the model. With that being said, I was still interested to see the correct solution.
2016-01-26 15:24:53	TAsn	yeah
2016-01-26 15:25:09	tbaxter	It's hard to give a corrrect solution with only a partial view of the problem

2016-01-26 21:15:02	dangayle	FunkyBob: It's not just querysets, it's also big chunks of view code from models that had to be evaluated at runtime that were prohibitively expensive.
2016-01-26 21:15:03	JonesP	My forms have foreign key relationships that need to be rendered, I allow the user to select a company. I guess I would just query the database for a list of all companies and build that into the form select box? It just doesn't seem very DRY. Django's form functionality is so elegant, I would hate to abandon it.

2016-01-26 21:37:55	v0r0nwe	JonesP: lets say, you have a view where the user shall use the form. this view is somehow served from django, with a template. in this template, all your client-side magic takes place. in there you could either include a js app that does api calls to get the form definition, or you render (via django, server-side) some initialization variables so that the js app doesn't need to make api calls just for
2016-01-26 21:37:56	v0r0nwe	retrieving the form. your form could have a .render_definition_to_json() method or whatever that you access in the template directly. as i said, all of this depends on the use case, app design, and so on...

2016-01-26 21:53:40	nowen	v0r0nwe: thanks
2016-01-26 21:53:42	vanflymen	or better, where
2016-01-26 21:53:42	JonesP	v0r0nwe: I think I have a solution. I can render an empty form using Django's template engine then make a request to the object from Angular and load the JSON into the form. My only issue is that <select> defaults to using primary keys for relations while I want REST to serve hyperlinks (to be more RESTFUL), I can solve this issue if I override the choicefield on my form and replace the pk with the proper URL. But that involves resolving the API URL for an obj

2016-01-26 22:05:49	FunkyBob	and again... your mixin should almost always pass its own class as the first arguyment to super()
2016-01-26 22:06:15	FunkyBob	I'm not familiar with the interface for ModelViewSets... do they work like Django's CBVs?
2016-01-26 22:06:37	vanflymen	Yes, I've done that now... so those two lines look like super(PartialUpdateMixin, self).get_object()

2016-01-26 22:16:51	FunkyBob	which is why super() needs to know where in the MRO sequence you want it to continue from... which is the first argument
2016-01-26 22:17:25	vanflymen	How does Python 3 get away with it then? Because you don't need to specify the class right?
2016-01-26 22:17:39	TheJoey	Oh, jeez. I seem to have underestimated the complexity/insanity of the django-nose code. This may require liquid sanity (a.k.a. whiskey) to work on.

2016-01-26 22:59:43	JonesP	If I can just change select to use URLs then the JSON will load and things will be perfect.

2016-01-26 23:27:25	moldy	anyway: where model inheritance really gets interesting is with polymorphism, imo.
2016-01-26 23:27:30	vyscond	c++ had objects but not everythin was objects
2016-01-26 23:27:56	mattmcc	There are a couple apps that help with the polymorphism problem: django-polymorphism, and django-model-utils.
2016-01-26 23:28:05	vyscond	moldy: you're talking about real inheritance or abstract model?
2016-01-26 23:28:06	moldy	mattmcc: yep!
2016-01-26 23:28:15	mattmcc	But I still think the whole approach is worth avoiding.

2016-01-26 23:28:56	mattmcc	moldy: What I see fairly often is people making classes for types of products, even though they don't really differ much.  Maybe a few fields here & there that may as well all be on the same table.

2016-01-27 09:45:58	jtiai	wyoung: xBBTx is right.
2016-01-27 09:46:01	wyoung	xBBTx: var1 is set into context by view
2016-01-27 09:46:19	mattblack123	thanks kezabelle
2016-01-27 09:46:22	mattmcc	mattblack123: So, request.POST is a QueryDict (which is a MultiValueDict).  Because it tries to act like a regular dict, request.POST['target'] will only give you one value.
2016-01-27 09:46:29	xBBTx	mattblack123: you probably want request.POST.getlist(...), why aren't you using the form for that though?
2016-01-27 09:46:29	jtiai	wyoung: Maybe you should do that really in a view.
2016-01-27 09:46:35	mattmcc	mattblack123: You want the getlist method, to get all the values.
2016-01-27 09:46:50	mattblack123	xBBTx: that's a manual built form
2016-01-27 09:46:59	mattmcc	However, yeah..  If you're processing the request with a form, you should really just use a form field that expects multiple values.
2016-01-27 09:47:08	xBBTx	so? you can/should still use Django forms to validate the input

2016-01-27 14:06:34	tbaxter	in that case, I'd just get all() and sort it out in python. I don't think all the aggregation/annotation in the world will really help you if you have to get all the data anyway.
2016-01-27 14:06:45	xBBTx	fission6, tbaxter can't you just build the 12 querysets and then pipe them together?
2016-01-27 14:07:20	fission6	all that is better than something like Link.objects.extra(select={'month': 'extract( month from pub_date )'}).values('month').annotate(dcount=Count('pub_date'))
2016-01-27 14:07:21	xBBTx	seems to me that each queryset can be annotated/aggregated as you wish, and the only varying parts are the year/month

2016-01-27 14:08:27	fission6	i dont get how this is even a debate really, why would you not have your DB doing your slicing and dicing
2016-01-27 14:08:33	iamkhush	xBBTx, the full view code?
2016-01-27 14:08:39	xBBTx	iamkhush: yes
2016-01-27 14:09:17	tbaxter	xBBTx: yes, you could.
2016-01-27 14:09:22	tbaxter	or you could get all.
2016-01-27 14:09:43	xBBTx	fission6: that's the optimal solution and for most cases it's feasible with the ORM, but if it turns out to be more work to get the ORM queryset together and you could've done it in python faster without too much of a performance hit, do the latter
2016-01-27 14:10:20	xBBTx	this is a bit of an edge case between nice clean design vs. premature optimization vs easy readability of the code
2016-01-27 14:10:44	tbaxter	fission6: that's the debate: you have LOTS of options, and you're fixating on one rather than starting with whatever may be simplest and going from there.
2016-01-27 14:10:44	fission6	xBBTx: and what sort of tools would you use to group by month year
2016-01-27 14:10:54	xBBTx	the python filtering will be more intuitive probably, but might be a performance hit, but that's a risk I would take for the sake of clarity/speed of implementation

2016-01-28 10:16:43	hkraal_	Currently I'm using a SSO service as auth backend, this backend however allows for spaces in the username which limits my ability to use /admin for editting the user as it won't pass the validation. Can I override the validation part somehow or should I really substitute the user model by my own?
2016-01-28 10:16:56	sebaj	Building a simple app and would prefer to just send users a link every time they want to log in, instead of bothering with passwords, social auth, etc.  Inspired by seeing Medium do this: https://medium.com/the-story/signing-in-to-medium-by-email-aacc21134fcd#.bfspkzanq
2016-01-28 10:17:30	sebaj	But is there an easy way to do this with existing django.contrib.auth instead of rolling my own?
2016-01-28 10:18:21	+apollo13	sebaj: yes, you just need to implement your own auth backend and maybe a custom login view, though you might be able to reuse most of it

2016-01-28 10:24:17	sebaj	@MarkusH that looks awesome - I figured somebody must have already done this.  Seems to me that so long as you expire tokens with SESAME_MAX_AGE, this is perfect.
2016-01-28 10:24:20	the_rat	It dismisses the issue saying "if the attacker obtains the URL they can already log in"
2016-01-28 10:24:39	+apollo13	the_rat: there is __no__ information leakage of the password
2016-01-28 10:25:05	sebaj	"Tokens are linked to the primary key and the password of the User. Changing the password invalidates the token. "

2016-01-28 11:25:05	karl164	hi, i'm using django to display some data on a website out of an oracle DB. The values are sorted and filtered by a timestamp. The timestamp has no index and i think this is the problem why the query takes way to long. How can i add an index in a existing Oracle DB and if a new row is pushed to the DB is it automatically indexed?
2016-01-28 11:25:33	+apollo13	MarkusH: so I'd argue that the attack vector might be different anyways, but I have to read that n detail

2016-01-28 11:27:27	karl164	apollo13: ok that means when an index is created for a field e.g. timestamp and a new row is pushed to the DP the new field will also have an index
2016-01-28 11:27:53	karl164	apollo13: that good ;) now how do i created the index in the firstplace for an existing data set
2016-01-28 11:27:55	rserro	apollo13: thanks, found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/releases/1.9/#django-template-base-add-to-builtins-is-removed
2016-01-28 11:28:08	the_rat	apollo13: I was wrong indeed. Because the "password" they are talking about is already the derived password as stored by Django. So it already includes a randomization part. I overlooked that part. I agree that it's quite far from revealing useful information. I just get a bit wary when I feel the same thing could be done without any *theoretical* information leak. But again, no practical concern.
2016-01-28 11:28:44	+apollo13	the_rat: yes, strictly speaking you are right about leaking the password, practically I am not sure if that is actually attackable in a sensible way
2016-01-28 11:28:54	+apollo13	the_rat: so sorry for my overreaction!
2016-01-28 11:29:01	+apollo13	karl164: look it up in the oracle documentation or use django's migrations
2016-01-28 11:29:14	primozk	karl164, add index_db=True to your timestamp field in Django and run migration
2016-01-28 11:29:36	the_rat	apollo13: I can totally understand where you were coming from, sorry for the careless commenting :)

2016-01-28 11:30:21	+apollo13	so what ;)
2016-01-28 11:30:39	karl164	primozk: the problem is that django has no write rights in my application. So i guess i have to do it directly with sql in the db.
2016-01-28 11:31:02	+apollo13	karl164: yes, your DBA certainly knows how to add the index though
2016-01-28 11:31:13	karl164	primozk: if i am only reading from the db make "index_db=True" a difference?
2016-01-28 11:31:15	+apollo13	that said, please check first if the index is actually needed instead of guesssing
2016-01-28 11:31:31	+apollo13	karl164: db_index is just a hint for django to create the index in the first place
2016-01-28 11:31:34	+apollo13	after that it does not care

2016-01-28 11:33:52	+apollo13	but yes, if you want a query sorted a index on the field can often get you far
2016-01-28 11:34:03	+apollo13	that is depending on the table size and actual amount of data you are fetching
2016-01-28 11:34:19	+apollo13	if the filter already returns just 10 rows fast, the order will never bother to use an index I think

2016-01-28 12:32:53	SteveRyherd	I was here yesterday and had a question about showing times in the Django Admin and having them appear in the proper timezone.
2016-01-28 12:33:56	SteveRyherd	If my list_display used the datetime field directly, it would work.   If I used a custom method __str__, it wouldn’t work, unless I returned the datetime field directly.

2016-01-28 12:36:06	SteveRyherd	After digging in the Django code a bit, it appears that the Django Admin list_display will go through each field check it’s type and then pass it to a localization function based on type… — with a string/text type, not all of this will happen
2016-01-28 12:36:49	SteveRyherd	So to directly print things in the proper timezone, the easiest thing to do is pass it to the localization function.

2016-01-28 14:35:44	hjwp	hm, i'm not using any multithreading or multiprocessing *as far as I know*
2016-01-28 14:35:48	hjwp	just unit tests hanging...
2016-01-28 14:35:59	JordiGH	hjwp: Basically, get_apps() does not have a recursive mutex, iirc. If an app does get_apps() while you're already in the middle of get_apps(), you'll deadlock.
2016-01-28 14:36:13	JordiGH	hjwp: Deadlocks don't require multithreading.
2016-01-28 14:36:21	tbaxter	maryokhin: why do you want to do that?
2016-01-28 14:36:24	JordiGH	They just require acquire the same non-recursive lock.

2016-01-28 14:38:28	JordiGH	If so, you'll figure out which app is deadlocking during load time. Something is trying to do something that it should not be doing during load time (personally, I think the mutex should be recursive, but that's kind of hard to get right)

2016-01-28 14:41:56	JordiGH	hjwp: You see it in the Celery stack trace?
2016-01-28 14:42:14	tbaxter	So, if the problem is 'typing CustomUser in the shell" what are you doing with the user object in the shell, and why not simply import customuser as user?
2016-01-28 14:42:52	tbaxter	I would not recommend calling your custom user object User, if only because it will be too confusing with auth.User. And in general, you shouldn't interact with the user object directly at all.
2016-01-28 14:43:07	tbaxter	you should be using settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL and letting it resolve, most times.
2016-01-28 14:43:38	maryokhin	tbaxter: I worked on 4 project where it was called User and never has there been anyone confused. You use get_user_model() imports anyway, so it doesn't matter
2016-01-28 14:44:09	hjwp	in /django/__init__.py?  just before it calls app.populate?  ok...
2016-01-28 14:44:25	akhil	Hi everyone, I have an app named messages and it is conflicting with the contrilb.messages module. If I do makemigration messages it creates inside the django.contrib.messages directory. How can I fix this other than renaming my messages app.
2016-01-28 14:44:38	maryokhin	tbaxter: that's all great, but I'm still interested in how I can rename it
2016-01-28 14:44:41	knbk	hjwp: I'd put it in apps.populate() just before it acquires the lock
2016-01-28 14:44:44	akhil	The project was earlier in django 1.5 and I'm trying to migrate it to django 1.8
2016-01-28 14:45:09	tbaxter	maryokhin: Just rename it and migrate. But I think you're making an unnecessary mistake.
2016-01-28 14:45:12	JordiGH	hjwp: In django/apps/registry.py at the populate call. Specifically, at the line that says "with self._lock:"
2016-01-28 14:45:22	hjwp	ok.  i'll stick a print in there.  any variables or other info you want me to inspect?
2016-01-28 14:45:44	knbk	hjwp: the stack trace is what's important
2016-01-28 14:45:45	maryokhin	tbaxter: that doesn't work, it throws "Unhandled pending operations for models", which is stupid, taking into account that the db table is the same
2016-01-28 14:45:46	JordiGH	hjwp: I'd do a breakpoint instead of a print, but people don't seem to like debuggers.
2016-01-28 14:46:04	JordiGH	If you're not on Windows, try pudb as a debugger.

2016-01-28 14:47:30	JordiGH	hjwp: In my opinion, people who don't like using debuggers just haven't found the right debugger.
2016-01-28 14:47:40	+apollo13	people haven't found gdb yet? :D
2016-01-28 14:47:57	JordiGH	hjwp: The important thing is the call stack. If you want to do printf-debugging, print the call stack.

X should be from A to Z, automaticall incremented. the first '####' is from 0000 to 9999 which should also be automatically incremented. so i'm thinking of creating 3 fields to represent this ID. so my question is, is there a way to autoincrement an alphabet and number and make it wrap around to the beginning ?

2016-01-29 13:45:51	tbaxter	request.context[tt] sounds right, but don't hold me to that.
2016-01-29 13:45:58	JordiGH	Y'know how makemigrations after a South upgrade (i.e. when there are no migrations at all) may create more than one initial migration because of circular dependencies? Wouldn't it make sense if `makemigrations` marked all of the initial migrations with `initial = True` so that you can just migrate with `--fake-initial`?
2016-01-29 13:46:11	JordiGH	Or am I not understanding how migrations work and why this is a bad idea?

2016-01-29 16:10:43	bahamas	hello. what's the best practice now about using a custom user model vs using a profile model?
2016-01-29 16:11:47	tbaxter	bahamas: IMO, it depends. Most times, I think subclassing AbstractUser ends up cleaner, easier, and with less joins/querying. But in some cases, it's desirable to keep the User object pure and clean, and just work from the profile model.

2016-01-29 16:12:03	TheJoey	It depends very much on your use case.
2016-01-29 16:12:28	TheJoey	bahamas: The documentation covers the use cases a little bit here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/auth/customizing/#extending-the-existing-user-model
2016-01-29 16:13:13	tbaxter	They do, but it's almost overwhelming and tends to confuse people
2016-01-29 16:13:44	TheJoey	Very true. Sounds like a point for improvement. :)

2016-01-29 16:14:33	TheJoey	Then again, I'm not Dutch, so I may just not be catching it.

2016-01-29 16:14:49	tbaxter	I do think extending AbstractUser would be the easiest to migrate away from if you found it wasn't the right choice. migrating from a profile model to a custom or extended user is tough.
2016-01-29 16:15:09	TheJoey	Yeah, I've done that before. It was a nightmare.

2016-01-29 16:15:49	tbaxter	Somebody on here, I forget who, suggested that even if you DO want a profle model, it would be smart to go ahead and stub out a subclass of abstractUser from the get-go and use that. Then, if you ever want to change, the foundations are already in place.
2016-01-29 16:16:02	tbaxter	That makes quite a bit of sense to me.

2016-01-30 17:52:21	+apollo13	this will allow you to serve custom content from there
2016-01-30 17:52:35	+apollo13	gp: if you remove a field you deploy the new code without the field first
2016-01-30 17:52:39	+apollo13	then you run the migration
2016-01-30 17:52:49	+apollo13	though in general you would not drop a field since it might require a table rewrite
2016-01-30 17:53:01	+apollo13	removing a model is also as simple as just deploying the new code
2016-01-30 17:53:11	+apollo13	it will not ref the model anymore and then you can safely drop it

2016-02-01 12:52:55	tbaxter	So, let me make sure I have the scenario straight. You have a bunch of objects and each has one image, or you have a bunch of objects and each has N objects?
2016-02-01 12:52:57	reez	ahh..thought i was in good direction. I was able to show my users using that
2016-02-01 12:53:26	reez	i have bunch of object and that object has N image
2016-02-01 12:54:03	tbaxter	never use values list unless you understand it's tradeoffs. I'm not sure what format_html_join is, but it sounds nasty. I'm guessing django_versatile_image is a thumbnailer of some sort?
2016-02-01 12:54:37	reez	i mean, i have a Machine model... which has picture that manytomany field to Gallery model
2016-02-01 12:54:50	tbaxter	ok, I would build the HTML directly in the model method. get_thumbnails() or somehting like that.
2016-02-01 12:54:57	tbaxter	you don't want values_list, definitely not
2016-02-01 12:55:03	reez	yes.. django versatile image is thumbnailer

2016-02-01 13:33:22	tbaxter	reez: Yes, it takes your objects and boils them down to just a value or two. That can be handy sometimes (usualy moreso than values()) but it means that they are not objects anymore. So following relationships is much more difficult, you have no methods, etc.
2016-02-01 13:33:50	tbaxter	That's why I warn people to not use values() or values_list() until they fully understand how those things break your objects.

2016-02-01 13:39:38	dang`r`us	the html generated by django (poke @ tbaxter: sniplates does this too) for checkboxes and radio buttons makes it impossible to style the box/radio thingy without javascript. Fix is rather easy though. Should I be brave and send a pull request?

2016-02-01 13:41:53	dang`r`us	the problem is (at least with all non-JS approaches known to me) you need to style the <label> depending on the state of <input> but css doesn't do parents

2016-02-01 13:44:21	dang`r`us	tbaxter, the label gets the custom graphic (check mark), the <input> gets hidden
2016-02-01 13:44:37	tbaxter	Not sure if it'll work, but label:active *might* be an option
2016-02-01 13:44:55	zanderle	moldy, yeah MarkusH suggested the same. I went with a different route in the end anyway. But thanks :)
2016-02-01 13:44:56	dang`r`us	well I'd need label:checked

2016-02-01 14:36:10	moldy	anyway, yes, i do recommend to ignore the problem for now. use runserver to develop and just push/deploy to remote heroku.

2016-02-01 18:22:21	tbaxter	so, /login/ (the URL) submits a GET request to the login view. A form submission will submit a POST request to the view. whatever is in GET will not be in POST and vice versa.

2016-02-01 18:24:13	tbaxter	just as an aside, I do not think you should write auth/registration views yourself. I think you should use a well-proven package like django-registration or allauth
2016-02-01 18:24:38	tbaxter	why are you allowing an unauthenticated user to ever get near a password change form?
2016-02-01 18:25:02	jtri	tbaxter: they can't, which is why they are redirected to login
2016-02-01 18:25:15	jtri	however, i just noticed that they don't redirect back to the change password page after logging in
2016-02-01 18:25:18	tbaxter	clearly they can, or you'd never hit that view at all
2016-02-01 18:25:35	jtri	fine, i see your point, it's an edge case
2016-02-01 18:25:45	tbaxter	Why are you not simply putting a login_required decorator on password change view
2016-02-01 18:25:49	tbaxter	it's not an edge case
2016-02-01 18:25:51	jtri	let me try another view
2016-02-01 18:26:18	tbaxter	it's a good example of why you shouldn't be doing this yourself. auth and registration are a really dangerous place to be learning.
2016-02-01 18:26:58	tbaxter	anyways, take a look at L12 (redirect_to = request.POST.get('next',).. I'm betting if you put PDB there, you'll find next isn't on request.POST at all
2016-02-01 18:27:47	jtri	tbaxter: that's what django itself is doing...

2016-02-01 18:38:13	jtri	as i mentioned, the cat poop, nails, and broken glass seem to be due to an attempt to abstract this all into urls.py

2016-02-01 18:40:16	tbaxter	how is that POSSIBLY the best approach?
2016-02-01 18:41:33	tbaxter	EVEN if you wanted your own form html -- which is unnecessary -- hacking at the view and/or form itself is problematic at best.

2016-02-01 18:48:52	tbaxter	jtri: I've suggested two already.
2016-02-01 18:48:57	jtri	i guess i'm leaning back towards dealing with the polution in urls.py and adding my own templates (which i can figure out by looking at the forms used in auth?)

So far, I've made it far enough to see that the jinja2 thing with typogrify is definitely in effect. Which means template tags that are *never* loaded in any template are somehow definitely coming into play.

2016-02-01 20:10:12	tbaxter	There's something in the first include that's making it fail, and they fail silently.
2016-02-01 20:10:42	kennethreitz	i would hope TEMPLATE_DEBUG would say something to that effect, but nada
2016-02-01 20:10:44	tbaxter	the include filter should only be used when proper template inheritance won't work, and you don't want an inclusion tag either.
2016-02-01 20:10:55	kennethreitz	that's the thing, the two files are nearly identical in form/function

2016-02-01 20:37:59	+apollo13	I bet chances are pretty good that if you install an app with template tags at least it's own templates are using it

2016-02-01 20:42:17	+apollo13	there is an import lock though
2016-02-01 20:42:30	vanflymen	The docs say that my_dict = Model.objects.filter(...).values() returns a dict... but it doesn't. It returns a QuerySet. I want to add an additional field to it: my_dict['key'] = value... and I get a TypeError. Any ideas?
2016-02-01 20:42:42	TheJoey	But it seems that the one module, which is unable to load, is causing all of typogrify's templatetags to fail loading. Is that correct, tbaxter?

2016-02-01 20:49:38	+apollo13	so in that sense the change was accidental
2016-02-01 20:50:04	+jarshwah	the django engine loads all of the templatetag libs though..
2016-02-01 20:50:13	+jarshwah	why would it be loading jinja tags?
2016-02-01 20:50:23	+apollo13	jarshwah: cause it doesn't know that this is a jinja tag
2016-02-01 20:50:26	+jarshwah	I'm not very familiar with the lib or using jinja in 1.9
2016-02-01 20:50:29	+apollo13	jinja module, whatever
2016-02-01 20:50:42	+apollo13	jarshwah: django just tries to import every module from tepmlatetags.X
2016-02-01 20:50:56	+apollo13	and that library in question has django_tags.py and jinja_tags.py in there…
2016-02-01 20:51:06	+jarshwah	mmm so maybe jinja template tags could/should be stored elsehwere? *shrug*
2016-02-01 20:51:11	+jarshwah	ohhh I see ok
2016-02-01 20:51:12	+apollo13	dunno
2016-02-01 20:51:33	tbaxter	Right. Techically, yeah, the jinja thing probably shoudl be under /jinja_tags or something, but it kinda did me a favor.

2016-02-01 20:52:06	+apollo13	"fix" for some defintion thereof
2016-02-01 20:52:43	+jarshwah	or make the templatetag lib take a dep on jinja so it's installed as well?

2016-02-01 20:53:14	+apollo13	cause it results in late errors

2016-02-01 20:54:18	+apollo13	and in general it is shorter and nicer
2016-02-01 20:54:21	tbaxter	I get some pretty hairy imports, and I don't like to import *
2016-02-01 20:54:27	+jarshwah	string imports are useful when you can't load the module *right now* .. like in django.conf.settings
2016-02-01 20:54:31	+apollo13	tbaxter: what is wrong with star imports?
2016-02-01 20:54:38	+apollo13	just get __all__ setup properly

2016-02-01 23:44:48	dang`r`us	fair enough
2016-02-01 23:45:06	dang`r`us	anyway, my question was: is it safe to assume a create mode of 644 or 444 or whatever. Because I'm patching pipeline.
2016-02-01 23:45:22	Jon_R	what do you mean by "assume"?

2016-02-01 23:45:40	dang`r`us	for this code path in pipeline

2016-02-01 23:46:35	Jon_R	i think unix standard practice is to create files as 0666 and let umask sort it out
2016-02-01 23:46:39	dang`r`us	ok
2016-02-01 23:46:40	dang`r`us	0666 it is.
2016-02-01 23:46:55	Jon_R	this is not a security hole as if the user sets a umask of 0 then they dug their own grave ;-)
2016-02-01 23:47:00	dang`r`us	agreed
2016-02-01 23:47:14	Jon_R	and the user may well have good reasons to want a umask of 002 instead of 022, or whatever

2016-02-02 00:35:19	arlekin	https://dpaste.de/g4vm
2016-02-02 00:35:35	arlekin	it basically complains about having None instead of port number
2016-02-02 00:35:42	arlekin	as far as i can tell
2016-02-02 00:35:47	Ruzzy	do you guys use any deployment tools for your django sites?
2016-02-02 00:36:05	dang`r`us	arlekin, okay ... hm.
2016-02-02 00:36:13	dang`r`us	sec
2016-02-02 00:36:20	arlekin	Ruzzy: somtimes i feel like a tool, but i doubt that helps ;P
2016-02-02 00:36:25	dang`r`us	Ruzzy, some lines of fabric
2016-02-02 00:37:21	dang`r`us	arlekin, do you have anything in your settings.py that's called REDIS_URL maybe? because when I create a redis connection it just works
2016-02-02 00:37:34	Ruzzy	arlekin: neat
2016-02-02 00:37:50	dang`r`us	if not, I'd say check out your utils/backends.py ... it might have some unreasonable assumptions
2016-02-02 00:38:03	Ruzzy	dang`r`us: how many things do you do with fabric? deploy, upgrade, rollback? more?
2016-02-02 00:38:11	dang`r`us	Ruzzy, just deploy

2016-02-02 00:50:28	arlekin	dang`r`us: i don't see how generic env package could figure specific redis object

2016-02-02 00:52:49	dang`r`us	which has a netloc property
2016-02-02 00:52:53	dang`r`us	however, not a hostname property.
2016-02-02 00:53:08	dang`r`us	netloc is a thing derived from the fact it's a url
2016-02-02 00:53:14	dang`r`us	(env.**url** in your code)
2016-02-02 00:53:32	dang`r`us	so I'm wondering what kind of env package you're using.
2016-02-02 00:53:40	arlekin	y their you mean environ ?
2016-02-02 00:54:03	arlekin	sorry i dont know how i bolded it
2016-02-02 00:54:09	dang`r`us	can you fire up a python shell and give me the result of:   import environ; print(environ)

2016-02-02 00:59:14	dang`r`us	so, what I'm confused about is that django-environ gives you netloc but your code wants a hostname.

2016-02-02 01:03:16	dang`r`us	cool
2016-02-02 01:03:35	arlekin	so apparently any further confusion ensued due to my tinkering with settings having this inserted in .env
2016-02-02 01:04:09	arlekin	when you asked for full traceback last time, i went to settings to turn everything back to starting state, but i forgot to do the same for .env

2016-02-02 02:04:54	dang`r`us	Ruzzy, I'm doing that
2016-02-02 02:05:11	dang`r`us	fabric can easily use a system-installed python2, whereas your project is confined to a py3 virtualenv
2016-02-02 02:05:14	dang`r`us	that's what I would suggest.
2016-02-02 02:05:16	Ruzzy	dang`r`us: from what I can see, the project itself isn't really operated on by fabric
2016-02-02 02:05:19	dang`r`us	exactly.
2016-02-02 02:05:41	Ruzzy	would I even need a virtualenv?
2016-02-02 02:05:47	FunkyBob	yes
2016-02-02 02:05:51	FunkyBob	always a virtualenv
2016-02-02 02:06:00	dang`r`us	technically you don't *need* it but ... like FunkyBob says ....
2016-02-02 02:06:09	Ruzzy	yeah I use one anyway, but do I actually need to separate my fab file from it?

2016-02-02 02:06:32	Ruzzy	because within the one env, I could easily use py2 to run the fabfile and py3 to run the project
2016-02-02 02:06:34	Ruzzy	right?
2016-02-02 02:06:43	dang`r`us	you run the fabfile with 'fab'

2016-02-02 02:07:06	Ruzzy	so other than that, I'm on the right track aren't i?
2016-02-02 02:07:09	dang`r`us	yeah.
2016-02-02 02:07:25	dang`r`us	personally I don't have a venv just for fabric - I've installed fabric via macports

2016-02-02 03:19:54	pembo13	i tend to think of it as do i want 1 line or multiline

2016-02-02 03:21:56	microdex	one definitely seems like a more comfortable default style, added bonus: smaller code
2016-02-02 03:22:23	pembo13	ok

2016-02-02 03:33:32	mattmcc	That's fine, store the file with FileField, and whatever other fields you need.
2016-02-02 03:33:51	microdex	FileField  and not TextField ?
2016-02-02 03:34:05	mattmcc	FileField will store the file on your server, and a filename in the DB.

2016-02-02 03:34:18	microdex	thanks mattmcc
2016-02-02 03:34:26	dang`r`us	microdex, not every database is as sophisticated as postgres. mysql probably has performance issues with text fields.
2016-02-02 03:34:31	dang`r`us	at least it used to
2016-02-02 03:34:41	dang`r`us	since they're not indexable or something.
2016-02-02 03:34:41	microdex	nice
2016-02-02 03:34:51	dang`r`us	(this might be outdated info)
2016-02-02 03:34:53	microdex	so with FileField,  can I run queries on the text of the files as well ?
2016-02-02 03:35:10	mattmcc	No, the idea is to not store the file in the DB, just a reference to the file.
2016-02-02 03:35:28	mattmcc	Of course, if it was an Excel file, you couldn't query its contents anyway.
2016-02-02 03:35:34	microdex	whats the benefit of storing it as FileField and creating files, vs. drumping it in TextField ?
2016-02-02 03:35:47	mattmcc	The benefit is that filesystems are better at storing files than databases.
2016-02-02 03:36:00	microdex	ok
2016-02-02 03:36:55	dang`r`us	also you'd need a db-file support layer for every tool that wants to access those files. Possible to do, yes, but a little clumsy

2016-02-02 03:44:10	FunkyBob	well, by many measures, since it uses SQL, it was never a RDBMS :)
2016-02-02 03:44:11	pembo13	being able to store schemalesss data doesn't make it not an RDBMS

2016-02-02 13:47:47	cesar_bo	abyss43_: different approach on implementation
2016-02-02 13:48:25	cesar_bo	To comply to MVC, requests are available just in the views, You are not meant to access the requests when you are on models for example
2016-02-02 13:48:51	abyss43_	cesar_bo: any ideas which is better? in django looks like its more explicit, however in flask, you dont have to pass the request to every view as parameters, it already has access, which i think is kinda nice too.
2016-02-02 13:49:23	tbaxter	abyss43_: Use CBVs :-)

2016-02-02 13:49:59	debugger22	I have a question
2016-02-02 13:50:12	debugger22	Why does Django applies migrations while testing?
2016-02-02 13:50:13	cesar_bo	tbaxter: classed based views? will be the same, the thing is that the Request object is just meant to be used in the view
2016-02-02 13:50:35	xBBTx	debugger22, migrations are an essential part of your project that can fail too
2016-02-02 13:50:49	debugger22	Only if someone changes it right?
2016-02-02 13:50:51	cesar_bo	debugger22: welcome to the club ! is annoying, but is how it's working now  :D

2016-02-02 13:51:08	debugger22	cesar_bo, Thanks!
2016-02-02 13:51:14	abyss43_	tbaxter: yeah true, but i was wondering in general is it a good idea to have a global variable, for e.g like request in flask, e.g having a global context variable, like request in flask, that can be accessed from anywhre. is it a good idea?
2016-02-02 13:51:17	cesar_bo	debugger22: you can use django-nose and the REUSE_DB=1 option to make te tests fast
2016-02-02 13:51:19	tbaxter	cesar_bo: Yeah, but with a CBV you don't have to pass it expliicity
2016-02-02 13:51:25	xBBTx	not necessarily, sometimes you end up in situations where you start from a migration and create a few new ones. applied one by one they are fine, but if you start from zero they fail

2016-02-02 13:52:48	r-ku	tbaxter like for django to pick up changes after i do settings.STATICFILES_DIRS.append() at some point during runtime
2016-02-02 13:52:50	cesar_bo	abyss43_: just in the programming sense I don't like to globals, are prone to unknowns bugs
2016-02-02 13:52:53	abyss43_	tbaxter: i guess the problem, is I have a bunch of functions, and I see myself explicitly trying to pass a context variable around, explicitly being good, however, i feel, its a bit inconvienient passing it around everytime from function to function

2016-02-02 13:53:38	tbaxter	abyss43_: are you saying that you have something you want always available in context
2016-02-02 13:53:46	r-ku	xBBTx figured as much hehe
2016-02-02 13:53:59	tbaxter	r-ku: that would have nothing to do with how staticfiles are handled
2016-02-02 13:54:25	cesar_bo	r-ku:  you could instead prefix your paths, like static('/themes/%s/img/logo.png' % request.user.theme')
2016-02-02 13:54:30	abyss43_	tbaxter: yes, and the ability to access the context, similar to how we access request in flask, but in django :)
2016-02-02 13:55:10	tbaxter	abyss43_: I think your mental model for request may be off (at least in django) but I think what you're looking for is a context processor or template tag
2016-02-02 13:55:54	r-ku	cesar_bo though be nice if i could have it all select right static folder auto, and templates folder too

2016-02-02 13:57:09	cesar_bo	r-ku: I made a similar feature, just create shortcuts that wraps the original get_template, or static templatetags
2016-02-02 13:57:49	r-ku	alright, thanks for pointing me the right way cesar_bo
2016-02-02 13:57:58	xBBTx	yeah, a custom templatetag like {% theme_static 'path/to/css' %} seems reasonable

2016-02-02 13:58:46	tbaxter	you sholdn't need to do anything except insert the var in to the path, if you've set up static files well. Then you have /{mythemvar}/css/, /{mythemevar}/js etc.
