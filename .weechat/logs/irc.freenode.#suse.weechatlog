2016-02-02 00:25:12	Firefishe	cisc: One variable I need to tell you about:  I used to be on Win7 before I upgraded to 10.  I used a win systemtray bluetooth Right-Click Menu command to turn the dongle off.  I would've tried that way to turn it back on, but I can't uninstall my Win10 bluetooth stack to install anything new.  I keep getting uninstall errors; but this isn't a win help channel, so I won't press.

2016-02-02 00:26:41	Stallmanu	your message doesnt count as 3 lines ;)
2016-02-02 00:26:46	cisc	turning the dongle on or off in Windows has nothing to do with if it will work or not under openSUSE

2016-02-02 00:27:43	cisc	Firefishe: so the dongle has problems under Windows?
2016-02-02 00:27:46	cisc	maybe it's a bad device?

2016-02-02 00:28:32	Firefishe	cisc:  It could be, it's old, but it hasn't failed yet.  It has to do with software being used to turn the internal chipset of the dongle off, manually.  I'd always been able to reenable it, however, using the same method.
2016-02-02 00:29:15	Firefishe	cisc:  However, now, I can't even install the latest win 10 software from the manufacturer.  I keep getting "uninstall current bluetooth software first" errors.
2016-02-02 00:29:56	Firefishe	cisc:  I *did* that, but the installer believes that something else is there, meaning, something didn't get removed.  I'm probably going to have to dig through the bloody registry.
2016-02-02 00:30:11	Firefishe	which is why I like suse :-)

2016-02-02 00:32:35	Firefishe	cisc:  I've also tried installing the broadcom (widcomm) software directly from Broadcom, but the installer is a pain.  It tried to detect the hardware first, before installing any software.  If it just installed the software, I wouldn't have an issue.
2016-02-02 00:32:47	Firefishe	cisc: It's software installation logistics that are kicking my arse right now.
2016-02-02 00:32:53	cisc	Firefishe: I would google the chipset, BCM2046B1 and start from there. I looked but everything was back in 2009 so its a pretty old device. maybe you should just spend 10 dollars and get a new one
2016-02-02 00:33:11	Firefishe	cisc: I'm beginning to believe I should, actually.
2016-02-02 00:33:55	Firefishe	cisc:  4.x bluetooth is better, anyway.  And with the new low power specification, it might even be more efficient.  This computer is vintage 2008, as well.  Really time for an upgrade.

2016-02-02 03:10:06	Stallmanu	Seems its some Sun related thing just from reading the comments near it

2016-02-02 15:17:00	zamba	hi! how is it to upgrade from suse 10.x to a newer version?
2016-02-02 15:17:08	zamba	i know.. it's so old it's embarassing
2016-02-02 15:17:22	zamba	do we need to perform a reinstall or can we do an in-place upgrade?
2016-02-02 15:17:40	revealed	better do a fresh install then, or parallel install and then move to, because you would have to take each newer release in every single step
2016-02-02 15:17:42	Somename	zamba: copy all needed info to flash drive. format disk and install fresh system :)

2016-02-02 15:18:39	revealed	So much changed :)
2016-02-02 15:18:48	zamba	another question.. i had to cancel a disk check during booting with ^C.. the system continued to boot and i was brought into X.. hostname set to (none) and i had to manually start services like ssh and vsftp
2016-02-02 15:18:48	Somename	don't upgrade it. otherwise you will have problems like mine
2016-02-02 15:18:59	zamba	and also setting the hostname manually
2016-02-02 15:19:08	zamba	what can i do to check that the system is "sane"?
2016-02-02 15:19:15	revealed	check the filesystem again
2016-02-02 15:19:25	zamba	revealed: i manually mounted the filesystem in question
2016-02-02 15:19:43	zamba	revealed: it was a data partition, so the root fs wasn't on it
2016-02-02 15:19:47	revealed	touch /force-fsck
2016-02-02 15:19:53	zamba	revealed: what will that do?
2016-02-02 15:19:56	revealed	Will issue automated filesystem check on boot
2016-02-02 15:19:59	revealed	on 10x
2016-02-02 15:20:08	zamba	sure.. but we don't necessary want to boot now
2016-02-02 15:20:14	zamba	it's a system that's required for 24/7 operations
2016-02-02 15:20:19	zamba	so we have to schedule this
2016-02-02 15:20:22	revealed	then unmounted the named partition and check it
2016-02-02 15:20:38	revealed	that file will schedule this for next reboot
2016-02-02 15:20:40	revealed	but remember in
2016-02-02 15:21:14	zamba	i may have phrased my question wrong.. the fs in question isn't the problem, but the state of the rest of the system, as i had to cancel the disk check during boot
2016-02-02 15:21:24	revealed	Ah so if it is not root you could unmount it and use man fsck
2016-02-02 15:21:39	zamba	sorry.. but we can't unmount it.. it's in use
2016-02-02 15:21:51	zamba	we have to schedule downtime to do that
2016-02-02 15:21:52	revealed	you can end the processes using it for the check
2016-02-02 15:21:59	zamba	that's what i did during boot
2016-02-02 15:22:07	revealed	consider services offline then using the data
2016-02-02 15:22:14	revealed	or schedule it for the maintainance downtime
2016-02-02 15:22:15	zamba	so my question is how i can make sure that my system is running "sanely"?
2016-02-02 15:23:11	zamba	after i had to cancel the boot process

2016-02-02 15:23:23	revealed	you can not check running filesystem this way from my state of knowledge
2016-02-02 15:23:45	revealed	schedule it for next boot
2016-02-02 15:24:02	zamba	i don't know if it's my english.. but i guess my question is not coming across
2016-02-02 15:24:06	revealed	Handling this wrong could cause severe damage to your FS
2016-02-02 15:24:07	zamba	the problem isn't the disk check
2016-02-02 15:24:47	zamba	the "problem" is the fact that i aborted the disk check while it was running using ctrl + c.. i then skipped the disk check.. and the system seemingly booted ok.. but quite a few services weren't running after the completed boot..

2016-02-02 15:25:02	zamba	so i had to start sshd and vsftpd manually afterwards, in addition to setting the hostname manually
2016-02-02 15:25:17	revealed	I would schedule downtime for now
2016-02-02 15:25:23	zamba	we need to keep this boat floating for a couple of days, to get the scheduled maintenance sorted..
2016-02-02 15:25:23	revealed	and do the check, let it finish
2016-02-02 15:25:25	revealed	and check logs

2016-02-02 15:26:02	directhex	is the download server considered working enough to install, now? i can't afford to sit here for some unknown number of hours staring at an unmoving green progress bar
2016-02-02 15:26:10	revealed	Because this may have a big rat tail behind if theres something wrong on the filesystem. You never know for now since you aborted the check.
2016-02-02 15:26:12	zamba	sure.. i know.. that's the ideal way.. but we can't schedule downtime NOW.. that's a contratiction
2016-02-02 15:26:28	zamba	contradiction, even
2016-02-02 15:26:40	revealed	Then i sugguest check your logs if all those services are fine. And pray? (Sorry)
2016-02-02 15:27:15	revealed	directhex: I expirienced similar today
2016-02-02 15:27:22	revealed	directhex: try a different mirror

2016-02-02 15:32:17	Someone2	I think it's better to do a fresh installation.
