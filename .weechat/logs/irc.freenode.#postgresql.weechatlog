Trying to start a fresh project and 'postgres -D pg &' tells me 5432 is already occupied, even after rebooting OSX. Can't figure out how to kill it.

2016-01-27 09:31:06	riceandbeans	in that case, how frequently should I set it to be on a cron?

2016-01-27 09:34:59	andres	xocolatl: access pattern in the first place. There's e.g. not much benefit in huge timeouts in insert only workload, with indexes only monotonic values.
2016-01-27 09:35:14	riceandbeans	what monitoring would tell me that I need to do a VACUUM FULL?
2016-01-27 09:35:22	xocolatl	riceandbeans: bloat estimation
2016-01-27 09:35:36	andres	xocolatl: also how well the workload fits into shared buffers - it's good if the majority of writes comes from the checkpointer, and that might chane with a huge timeout.
2016-01-27 09:35:37	xocolatl	riceandbeans: vacuum full is very invasive and should not be run blindly
2016-01-27 09:35:46	andres	Also the amount of recvoery time obviously plays a role.

2016-01-27 10:20:42	Zr40work	no, postgres is the postgres default. Packages may have chosen a different name
2016-01-27 10:21:12	riceandbeans	on any BSD build it will be pgsql

2016-01-27 12:56:02	CalimeroTeknik	on update is enough?

2016-01-27 12:56:10	xocolatl	of course not
2016-01-27 12:56:14	nbjoerg	chridal: but the limiting happens *after* sorting
2016-01-27 12:56:21	CalimeroTeknik	should it be a 'constraint trigger'?
2016-01-27 12:56:28	nbjoerg	chridal: so you want to make sure that the sorting is indexed
2016-01-27 12:56:53	chridal	nbjoerg: Aha. But say there'd usually be 100 comments in each set with the occasional having a couple of thousand
2016-01-27 12:57:04	chridal	It's not actually for an article/comment system but a chat. Contrived example :-)
2016-01-27 12:57:19	CalimeroTeknik	xocolatl, I've been looking for an example of constraint-enforcing triggers, is there one somewhere?

2016-01-27 13:05:04	chridal	nbjoerg: Just one more question if it's ok. Say I have a table TimedToken which has `token` VARCHAR and `expires_at` DATETIME and my query looks like this SELECT * FROM timed_tokens WHERE token=$sometoken expires_at > $somedatetime. Would I then need an index on both of them or would the planner look for the token first and only look for expires_at if it first has a hit on the token?
2016-01-27 13:06:07	srle	RhodiumToad: regarding option (1), it is like creating new additional table(despite the one that im using now for reading aggregated balance), where per one customer i will have just one record. That table would be updated whenever new bet is created and aggregated balance is calculated?
2016-01-27 13:06:12	johto	chridal; is token not unique?
2016-01-27 13:06:19	chridal	johto: Yes, its unique.
2016-01-27 13:06:32	johto	chridal; then there's no point in having any other indexes for this query
2016-01-27 13:06:36	RhodiumToad	srle: doesn't need to be actually updated, just so you can do select for update on it as a locking mechanism
2016-01-27 13:06:56	johto	chridal; postgres would first look up the token through the unique index and then discard the only row if it has already expired
2016-01-27 13:06:57	chridal	johto: Aha. So the planner will recognize this and not look for both expires_at and token because token is indexed unique?
2016-01-27 13:07:06	chridal	johto: Brilliant. Thanks.
2016-01-27 13:07:07	srle	RhodiumToad: but if not updated what i will get back as a result of SELECT for UPDATE statement?
2016-01-27 13:07:07	andres	RhodiumToad: IIRC we still can only specify deferred triggers if they constraint ones, right? I wonder what's the point in retaining that restriction.

2016-01-27 13:07:25	chridal	:-)

2016-01-28 12:57:48	johto	"a bit slow" is a quite an understatement if the system has a total of 128MB memory
2016-01-28 12:58:15	RhodiumToad	the default shared_buffers has crept up over releases, the default is now 128MB
2016-01-28 12:58:35	RhodiumToad	so running a recent pg on a 128MB system will involve configuring that to a smaller value

2016-01-28 15:02:17	crobbins	MatheusOl,  you access a column from the table to be updated in an expression, UPDATE uses the current value of the column. For example, the following statement sets col1 to one more than its current value:
2016-01-28 15:02:30	crobbins	here's the good part: The second assignment in the following statement sets col2 to the current (updated) col1 value, not the original col1 value. The result is that col1 and col2 have the same value. This behavior differs from standard SQL.

2016-01-29 11:00:51	schaary	hi - I have a postgresql server 9.4 and my default encoding is de_DE.utf-8. But now I need to create a new database which expects latin1 as encoding and locale. can I mix both encodings on the same server somehow?

2016-01-29 12:30:46	diphtherial	one thing of note is that my queries have a locality defined by the user's active period, so it'd be nice to be able to take advantage of that when deciding what partitions to consult...e.g. if i know the user has no posts after 2012, there's no need to consult anything further

2016-01-29 12:32:01	MatheusOl	diphtherial: If you have "first_post_date,last_post_date", you need to use that explicitly as a parameter in the query, so you'd need two queries

2016-01-29 12:50:10	diphtherial	should it be possible to upgrade from 9.2 to 9.4 without having to dump and reload the database?
2016-01-29 12:50:14	chridal	The whole concept of docker is trying to have parity between dev/staging/testing/prod
2016-01-29 12:50:20	diphtherial	i understand there's a pg_upgrade tool to do so
2016-01-29 12:50:45	MatheusOl	lucian: if there are more checkpoints then usual, then they are being triggered by checkpoint_segments (or explicitly forced) instead of checkpoint_timeout
2016-01-29 12:50:46	chridal	Docker is sort of an abstraction layer that has its own OS, its own filesystem, its own memory. But it can not be compared to Vagrant.
2016-01-29 12:50:48	chridal	Docker is not a VM.
2016-01-29 12:50:57	MatheusOl	diphtherial: yes, with pg_upgrade
2016-01-29 12:51:08	chridal	It uses the same kernel as the host you're running Docker on.
2016-01-29 12:51:10	average	chridal: parity between dev/staging/testing/prod was also the goal of vagrant/puppet
2016-01-29 12:51:14	lucian	MatheusOl: right. i tried increasing checkpoint_segments to 10, but it doesn't seem to affect anything
2016-01-29 12:51:24	average	but then game docker and flipped over the table
2016-01-29 12:51:30	chridal	average: Yes, but Vagrant is using a VM. Also Puppet is just an orchestration tool.
2016-01-29 12:51:40	average	chridal: do you use puppet with docker ?
2016-01-29 12:51:43	MatheusOl	lucian: check the logs first, blind guess doesn't seem like a good approach
2016-01-29 12:51:57	chridal	average: No. Puppet is too complex for what we're trying to accomplish. I am thinking about using Centurion though.

2016-01-29 13:00:48	dstarh	I've got two databases, one my full db and another the test db with minimal data in it.  I needed to drop an empty table and in my full db it took a moment or two but it happened just fine.  Now in my test database I cannot drop it.  I get no errors nothing in the logs it just sets and nothing happens

2016-01-29 20:23:16	dvl	The CYCLE option allows the sequence to wrap around when the maxvalue or minvalue has been reached by an ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is reached, the next number generated will be the minvalue or maxvalue, respectively.

2016-01-30 17:37:49	Devastator	confuso_argento I know this way, but I was wondering if I could do it using constraint with a name etc
2016-01-30 17:37:56	nivag	Devastator, unless you have multiple fields in your PRIMARY KEY, just put 'PRIMARY KEY' directly after it
2016-01-30 17:38:11	confuso_argento	I personally like to do CREATE TABLE example (id INT PRIMARY KEY, otherfield INT NOT NULL);
2016-01-30 17:38:14	johto	Devastator; NOT NULL Constraints aren't "real" constraints like that. they don't have names, ever
2016-01-30 17:38:29	johto	Devastator; they're just a property of the column
2016-01-30 17:38:31	Devastator	johto ok, thanks!
2016-01-30 17:38:39	confuso_argento	Devastator: Yes you can. You can actually define any contraint that way
2016-01-30 17:39:15	Devastator	it's just because I've learned to create constraints for everything, because it was easier to alter a table

2016-01-30 17:40:27	Devastator	johto is it good practice to create constraints for the other types? like unique, primary key etc?
2016-01-30 17:40:54	Devastator	nivag I've seen a database with no primary key in several tables
2016-01-30 17:40:55	johto	a constraint is created in any case
2016-01-30 17:40:55	confuso_argento	nivag: I think that comes from another DB engine that doesn't understand what a PK is :P
2016-01-30 17:41:35	johto	I personally put PK, UNIQUE and CHECK constraints at the end rather than with the columns
2016-01-30 17:41:56	nivag	confuso_argento, There is but ONE TRUE DB, and that is PostgreSQL, forsake all others!  :-)
2016-01-30 17:41:59	johto	mostly because some constraints cover more than one column and then you *have* to put it at the end, creating an inconsistent mes

2016-01-30 17:42:27	confuso_argento	nivag: I rest my case! ;)

2016-02-01 10:00:07	kenalex	which method do you guys consider better for storing application wide configuration (business logic settings): 1) having a table with character as key labeling the configuration data and a json field with config data as json object or a setting  table with table per type each config data given that  each config type has diffreing attributes ?
2016-02-01 10:00:12	spsneo	I have a master-slave setup. I want to import a huge table in the master. What is the best way to import data. My fear is that slave replication will not be able to catch up and hence I will have to do setup slave again. Please suggest what to do.

2016-02-01 16:49:02	colin_	Hey guys. I am trying to build a slave in postgres 9.4, and it seems to be having trouble with tablespaces. I have tried rsyncing the files a few different ways, but getting similar errors each time when I start the slave up and try to connect to the postgres service.
2016-02-01 16:49:16	sanchit	It has around 1800 wal files to recover and 2 hours behind by primary

2016-02-01 16:49:48	sanchit	It recovers a wal file and then it goes in waiting state again
2016-02-01 16:50:22	confuso_argento	colin_: use repmgr, ease the pain
2016-02-01 16:50:23	sanchit	oh k , can it cause a replication stall if user query state is "idle in transaction ( aborted )"

2016-02-01 17:03:54	Zr40	if you somehow can't fix the application, you can set max_standby_streaming_delay (if streaming) or max_standby_archive_delay (if using an archive) to cancel whatever transaction is blocking replication for longer than that delay

2016-02-01 21:55:28	zap0	table creation issue (i think)  i have two tables with a REFERENCE to each others 'id SERIAL' column,  in what order do you create the tables?   as the 1st one  will be referencing one that is not created yet?
2016-02-01 21:55:32	iKlsR	MatheusOl, yes

2016-02-01 22:16:13	andres	DeciBull: I think in practice on bigger/busier databases that actually plays less and less of a role. In most such cases you recover from a crash (pg and/or hardware) with a failover anyway.
2016-02-01 22:16:19	johto	if there are 0 rows that have a higher score, then the rank is count
2016-02-01 22:16:22	johto	sorry, the rank is 1
2016-02-01 22:16:34	johto	1 row with a higher score, the rank should be 2. etc.  so count(*) + 1

2016-02-01 23:04:17	andres	If you want to query the standby hot_standby has to be enabled (that's the feature allowing access to the standby!). If you have problems with row versions being removed at the primary, causing problems when replayed on the standby, you can enable hot_standby_feedback, which will cause the primary to not remove still required data.

2016-02-01 23:08:08	jayjo	OK I will do that. Just to understand it more, if I were not to enable hot_standby on the standby, it would only serve replication purposes and I would not be able to query it with any user. Once it is enabled, which it appears that I am connected to the standby but when I read the primary is being updated so the rows have changed since my query began, which terminates my query. So I enable hot_standby_f
2016-02-01 23:08:14	jayjo	eedback on the standby, which will communicate to the primary when it is being queried and lock the table it is querying from?
2016-02-01 23:08:44	johto	it won't lock anything. it just prevents dead rows from being cleaned up

2016-02-02 01:42:53	jayjo	Reading up on the docs I'm now confused. Are lateral joins the same as correlated subqueries? Or can one be used as the other? In the docs it says a lateral join enables a subquery in the from part of a clause, but most explanations of it (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28550679/what-is-the-difference-between-lateral-and-a-subquery-in-postgresql) say it is a correlated subquery and is run once for ev

2016-02-02 05:15:23	mdizzy	Hi all. I notice that my postgresql setup favors hash join over nested loop + index scan over seq scan, even though using nested loop is 100 faster. Checking the cast estimates, I see that postgresql thinks seqscan are cheap. Should I lower random_page_cost?

2016-02-02 08:50:00	w0rp	Does anyone have any recommended guides or documentation on performance tuning, with respect to when the query planner elects to use an index?
2016-02-02 08:50:30	w0rp	I just spotted a query being run, on my machine at least, where it didn't use an index for a foreign key, and as a result the execution time is much higher. If I force it in the CLI to use the index, it runs much faster.
2016-02-02 08:50:42	w0rp	I'm guessing that it's overestimating the cost of the index for that table.

2016-02-02 14:06:03	xocolatl	it'll work on integer, I think
2016-02-02 14:06:07	xocolatl	it should anyway
2016-02-02 14:06:09	ash_workz	if I have a table that has identifiers for number ranges (start, end, id) which would look something like (1,10,A) "A block is 1 - 10" then you can do something like `SELECT 8 FROM blocks WHERE 8 BETWEEN start AND end` and that would return A?
