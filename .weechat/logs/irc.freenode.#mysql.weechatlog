2016-01-26 12:16:52	daspence	My friend is currently using MySQL Connector/ODBC 5.3.4 (64-bit) for Windows 7.

2016-01-26 12:16:52	daspence	I'm thinking this is due to an older password protocol on the client end?

2016-01-26 12:53:26	Cupertina	Hi guys. So I'm creating an instant messenger application. My schema is as such:
2016-01-26 12:53:28	Cupertina	User(UserID,Username,Password) and Contact(UserID, UserID)
2016-01-26 12:53:39	Cupertina	 The issue though is lets say that I added johndoe as a contact and the record (1,2) is created in the Contact table. How do I prevent johndoe from also adding me at the database level. In other words, prevent (2,1) from being inserted into the Contact table.

2016-01-26 16:42:49	niim	I read best way to store a hashed password is binary type and length based on the hash
2016-01-26 16:42:55	niim	and that md5 is 16 bytes, so binary(16) should be enough to store it
2016-01-26 16:43:02	niim	but when I try to insert md5(string) it gets truncated. what am i missing
2016-01-26 16:43:47	thumbs	niim: show your test case.
2016-01-26 16:44:42	niim	INSERT INTO `game`.`accounts` (`userID`, `userName`, `userPass`) VALUES (NULL, 'test', MD5('test'));
2016-01-26 16:44:50	snoyes	niim: which version of MySQL? later ones return a 32-digit hex string, not the binary string
2016-01-26 16:45:08	niim	5.6.17
2016-01-26 16:45:20	niim	so i need to unhex()
2016-01-26 16:45:21	snoyes	then you need to UNHEX() it before storing in a binary field
2016-01-26 16:45:21	niim	?
2016-01-26 16:45:25	niim	awesome

2016-01-26 16:45:58	niim	storage of 32 vs processing time of hex unhex?
2016-01-26 16:46:07	snoyes	16 bytes of storage per row. In terms of performance/time, probably so small you'll never notice the difference.
