2016-01-26 15:49:56	singalaut	If you don’t want to build lua or rewrite the script, you can just set the short_name yourself manually or with buffer_autoset.py. For example in #weechat buffer: /eval /buffer set short_name ${color:red}#weechat
2016-01-26 15:50:28	silverd	singalaut, are yo going tu push request this into the official script repository ?
2016-01-26 15:50:54	singalaut	No. I rarely submit my script to official script repo
2016-01-26 15:51:09	hiptobecubic	singalaut, does this always do whatever the nick colorizer does?
2016-01-26 15:51:10	silverd	yea i could do that but i'd prefer it to use nick colors
2016-01-26 15:51:22	silverd	since my highmon bar uses them too
2016-01-26 15:51:30	hiptobecubic	i.e. if we don't color nicks but do want to color buffers, is that possible?
2016-01-26 15:51:48	silverd	alright then i'll see if i can port to perl or something

2016-01-26 15:56:42	hiptobecubic	singalaut, well I see 'irc_nick_color', but does that do everything internally or just return the color that would be used for a given string?
2016-01-26 15:57:22	hiptobecubic	it's not hard to just define another setting chat_short_name_colors, but if there's no way to grab them then it's not so interesting :)

2016-01-26 16:02:11	hiptobecubic	Oh I see... we just pretend that the buffer name is a nick and then ask for its color... so there's no real way around it without doing an ugly hack like swapping the colors on and off while asking

2016-01-27 13:58:37	jazzpi	thanks anyways, this makes it much easier :D
2016-01-27 13:59:15	sim642	there's a separate "tags" key in irc_message_parse
2016-01-27 13:59:54	sim642	the signal should return the raw line you need to pass into irc_message_parse
2016-01-27 13:59:58	jazzpi	yeah i know, but the signal_data in the callback is just the message_without_tags part

2016-01-27 15:47:45	jazzpi	yes, but i'm not sure how to print it and then tell IRC to not print it but send it to the server
2016-01-27 15:47:46	sim642	why do you need to modify your own line though
2016-01-27 15:48:11	jazzpi	because my user also has a color and additional prefixes that i'd like to display
2016-01-27 15:48:23	sim642	I'm not sure how well it plays with the idea of color.chat_nick_self
2016-01-27 15:48:48	sim642	there's irc_out_* signal as well
2016-01-27 15:49:06	sim642	which might be a better idea than hooking some input signal

2016-01-27 15:50:42	jazzpi	i'll try that, thanks so much for all the help :)

2016-01-28 06:51:08	Tsutsukakushi	hello
2016-01-28 06:51:42	Tsutsukakushi	04 and 05 look the same to me, shouldn't one be dark and one light?
2016-01-28 06:53:18	@FlashCode	Tsutsukakushi: color 04 should be dark blue and 05 dark magenta
2016-01-28 06:53:31	@FlashCode	see weechat -c  in a terminal (or /color then alt-c on the buffer)
2016-01-28 06:53:37	Tsutsukakushi	my colours are fucked up then
2016-01-28 06:53:50	@FlashCode	http://weechat.org/files/temp/shots/weechat_colors.png
2016-01-28 06:53:55	@FlashCode	you should see that ^^
2016-01-28 06:54:24	@FlashCode	(if you have setup 256 colors)
2016-01-28 06:55:35	gb	really need to get a regex filter for those who have no self control
2016-01-28 06:56:06	Tsutsukakushi	it shows only 8 colours after M-c
2016-01-28 06:56:18	Tsutsukakushi	and they are not what i see when i do thist
2016-01-28 06:56:41	gb	even if just to rm the lines where people show lack of restraint and not the nicks garbage completely
2016-01-28 06:57:44	Tsutsukakushi	which is odd considering how all 01-15 are bold to me
2016-01-28 06:59:20	gb	it'd be good if weechat had a way for certain words in the input bar got changed to #'s on pressing spce/enter via a default trigger which they could then disable if they realy wish to be moron's but by default not inflict the rest of us :-)

2016-01-28 07:05:27	gb	i've never needed to do it but was just curious if a new default trigger was added to a later release

2016-01-28 10:23:53	TheAnachron	I am a big fan of gpg lately :) I'll see if I can use /secure though. (even it creates just another passphrase and just another encrypted store)

2016-01-28 10:29:11	TheAnachron	gb: the documentation does not show any evidence for that
2016-01-28 10:30:09	@FlashCode	TheAnachron: the user's guide has a chapter about secured data
2016-01-28 10:30:28	@FlashCode	I'll add that in quickstart guide (only the basic commands, ie set passphrase and secured data, and how to use it in options)
2016-01-28 10:31:09	@FlashCode	the quickstart gives only very basic commands, the user's guide gives detail about everything (except the API, which is a separate doc)

2016-01-28 10:32:41	TheAnachron	Just a quick question ... I have my nicks set to "TheAnachron"
2016-01-28 10:32:50	TheAnachron	when I connect to freenode it will change my name to TheAnach1
2016-01-28 10:32:58	TheAnachron	So /msg NickServ wont accept my nick
2016-01-28 10:33:11	TheAnachron	Why is that? I dont have this issue with irssi
2016-01-28 10:33:22	@FlashCode	TheAnachron: here's a version of quickstart with secured data: http://weechat.org/files/temp/doc/weechat_quickstart.en.html
2016-01-28 10:33:36	sim642	TheAnachron, you should use SASL to authenticate anyway
2016-01-28 10:34:10	@FlashCode	yes better use SASL, this will solve this auth problem
2016-01-28 10:34:14	TheAnachron	sim642: I was trying identify first because I couldn't igure out how to use gpg with weechat. (I'm noob, I installed the weechat package like 5 min ago)
2016-01-28 10:35:40	TheAnachron	I'll go the route of /secure for now. When will the passphrase be asked for?
2016-01-28 10:36:10	@FlashCode	when weechat is starting
2016-01-28 10:36:27	sim642	FlashCode, is there a reason printf_date and printf_tags aren't available for scripts while printf_date_tags is?
2016-01-28 10:36:32	sim642	doesn't make much sense
2016-01-28 10:36:52	@FlashCode	sim642: these functions have only some arguments
2016-01-28 10:37:01	@FlashCode	printf_date_tags is more powerful (it does everything)
2016-01-28 10:37:05	@FlashCode	so not needed to have the others
2016-01-28 10:37:17	sim642	yeah, but if the others exist already, why not allow them in scripts as well
2016-01-28 10:37:36	@FlashCode	they exist just internally (for core)
2016-01-28 10:37:45	sim642	they exist for plugins too
2016-01-28 10:37:53	@FlashCode	they are not used by plugins
2016-01-28 10:37:59	@FlashCode	hmm I don't think so
2016-01-28 10:38:02	sim642	they only exist in plugins
2016-01-28 10:38:09	sim642	IRC uses printf_tags
2016-01-28 10:38:14	sim642	trigger as well I think

2016-01-28 10:41:29	singalaut	“X is more powerful (it does everything)” if we use this rule, a lot of functions that can be replaced with string_eval_expression should be removed :D this means a lot of string_* functions and even buffer_get_* functions :D
2016-01-28 10:41:54	@FlashCode	sim642: and these 2 functions bring almost nothing new (they are reduced versions of printf_data_tags)
2016-01-28 10:41:54	sim642	it's just that, since the functions already exist and are used for some plugins, there's no reason to not allow others to use them
2016-01-28 10:42:00	sim642	I know

2016-01-28 10:44:06	TheAnachron	Now thats cool!!!
2016-01-28 10:44:15	@FlashCode	TheAnachron: in the quickstart guide I give only an example with SASL (with is better than nickserv)
2016-01-28 10:44:18	TheAnachron	Thanks :D so I will rather use that because #archlinux wont support SASL.
2016-01-28 10:44:32	sim642	SASL is server based, not channel based
2016-01-28 10:44:33	@FlashCode	SASL is server related, not channel related
2016-01-28 10:44:56	TheAnachron	Uhm? So freenode doesnt support SASL?
2016-01-28 10:44:58	TheAnachron	Or my config is wrong?
2016-01-28 10:45:02	@FlashCode	sim642: yes, printf is defined, because it's the most commonly used form (and shorter to write!)

2016-01-28 10:45:46	TheAnachron	I did /set irc.server.freenode.sasl_username "TheAnachron"

2016-01-28 10:46:13	@FlashCode	TheAnachron: freenode supports SASL
2016-01-28 10:46:46	gb	i would check /server raw to see if the server did not get a " by mistake or something different to what you think you set it too

2016-01-29 11:50:12	TheAnachron	On their website they have https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC
2016-01-29 11:50:23	TheAnachron	So the port seems to be 6697
2016-01-29 11:50:35	sim642	it's 6697 for SSL
2016-01-29 11:50:38	Yaniel	that https is just for the wiki
2016-01-29 11:51:01	Yaniel	Non-SSL: 6665 - 6669
2016-01-29 11:51:04	Yaniel	    SSL: 6697, 8443
2016-01-29 11:51:07	Yaniel	according to the MOTD
2016-01-29 11:51:09	sim642	not sure if they even have non-ssl ports :P
2016-01-29 11:51:17	sim642	oh I guess they do but just don't recommend those

2016-01-29 11:52:59	Yaniel	why did you quit weechat
2016-01-29 11:53:36	TheAnachron	Because I have no idea how to edit a created server :X
2016-01-29 11:53:45	Yaniel	/help server
2016-01-29 11:54:11	TheAnachron	No I need to edit the adress
2016-01-29 11:54:18	TheAnachron	Tried /set mozilla.addresses irc.mozilla.org/6697
2016-01-29 11:54:21	TheAnachron	but that was not successful
2016-01-29 11:54:46	Yaniel	you might have to disconnect from that server firsrt
2016-01-29 11:54:47	sim642	because that's not the option name
2016-01-29 11:55:02	sim642	irc.server.mozilla.addresses would be
2016-01-29 11:55:03	Yaniel	irc.server.mozilla.addresses
2016-01-29 11:55:05	sim642	use iset
2016-01-29 11:55:05	TheAnachron	Uhm? In my irc.conf it is.
2016-01-29 11:55:07	Yaniel	iset is your friend
2016-01-29 11:55:11	TheAnachron	Ok
2016-01-29 11:55:12	sim642	don't edit conf files directly
2016-01-29 11:55:47	Yaniel	I'm every now and then seriously thinking binary config files would be a good thing
2016-01-29 11:56:05	TheAnachron	;D because of me? haha
2016-01-29 11:56:09	sim642	Yaniel, if it ain't broken don't fix it
2016-01-29 11:56:25	TheAnachron	Yeaha. I changed the port and now mozilla can be connected to
2016-01-29 11:56:30	TheAnachron	now lets see about that usernmae
2016-01-29 11:56:33	sim642	moving to binary configs would be just prone to more errors, especially coding

The /server add syntax seems to be, for example, /server add freenode chat.freenode.net. But the only server info mibbit gives me is Rizon. How do I connect? I tried /server add rizon. chat.rizon.net as a guess. Just got a message saying connecting. NOthing more. mibbit seems to indicate it is
2016-01-29 14:34:18	beekindimnu	an active server.

2016-01-29 14:37:23	Alissa	Second, are you sure it didn't finish connecting?
2016-01-29 14:37:38	kspencer	chat.rizon.net doesn't exist so it won't connect

2016-01-29 14:39:45	Alissa	It does for me.
2016-01-29 14:40:01	Alissa	It's CNAMEd so there's no A records
2016-01-29 14:40:03	Alissa	but it does exist
2016-01-29 14:41:55	meingtsla	chat.rizon.net CNAMEs to qchat.rizon.net, which appears to point to the web irc rizon provides
2016-01-29 14:42:20	beekindimnu	I'll look at ##linux. No it doesn't connect. Just keeps retrying. Why wouldn't mibbit list the server as say chat.rizon.net? Is does every irc server have the same format, just different name, i.e. freenode, rizon, etc.
2016-01-29 14:42:28	meingtsla	irc.rizon.net
2016-01-29 14:43:04	Alissa	^
2016-01-29 14:44:52	beekindimnu	thanks. how did you find that is is irc.rizon.net?
2016-01-29 14:45:12	Alissa	Just a guess; most servers have it via irc.*
2016-01-29 14:45:22	meingtsla	Through their website, https://www.rizon.net/info/access
2016-01-29 14:45:32	Alissa	That works too.
2016-01-29 14:45:38	Alissa	https://www.irccloud.com/static/networks.json I found that, as well.

2016-01-29 15:23:24	_`_	yes it means your message wasn't sent. maybe it has a mode where it requires you to be registered to talk or something.
2016-01-29 15:23:39	Zarthus	it often means they've quieted unregistered users

2016-01-30 12:12:03	gb	i use it no trouble here but some url's do not get passed correctly sometimes for some reason
2016-01-30 12:12:14	tuelz	don't know that I've ever shared anything on slack but funny pictures before, but that's still something that could use an IRC backend
2016-01-30 12:12:39	tuelz	for chatting, that is
2016-01-30 12:14:02	de-vri-es	personally I find lack of emoji support a feature (even though you could have emoji in IRC)
2016-01-30 12:14:21	de-vri-es	file transfers in queries could be neat
2016-01-30 12:14:57	indeedwatson	my dream is to have twitch emotes on terminal so i can join twitch chat through irc and use kappa
2016-01-30 12:15:26	de-vri-es	and some possibility for fetching backlog from a server over IRC protocol could be neat
2016-01-30 12:15:34	de-vri-es	though freenode wont want to keep backlog, I'm sure
2016-01-30 12:15:39	de-vri-es	but it would be great for bouncers

2016-01-30 12:21:15	indeedwatson	maybe i wasn't clear: i can click links now no problem, if i stay in non-256 colors urxvt
2016-01-30 12:21:23	de-vri-es	not ideal to have to switch, but since I use tmux it has to be my terminal launching the browser
2016-01-30 12:21:42	de-vri-es	aha, I do believe I use 256 colors urxvt
2016-01-30 12:21:51	de-vri-es	I never tried clicking

2016-01-30 12:22:35	gb	you can launch a browser from screen gui or console pretty sure it'd be possible in tmux too
2016-01-30 12:23:25	de-vri-es	clicking or ctrl+clicking does nothing

2016-01-30 12:25:15	gb	it's easier to launch gui browsers via your term though once configured crrectly
2016-01-30 12:25:38	gb	ir ot a weechat thing
2016-01-30 12:25:45	gb	ie not
2016-01-30 12:26:04	gb	i should rest/stop typing
2016-01-30 12:26:12	de-vri-es	right, but still interesting to know if tmux supports somethign like it
2016-01-30 12:26:16	de-vri-es	it does sound slightly dangerous
2016-01-30 12:26:25	Rasi	how can i enable tab completion again

2016-02-01 13:29:52	fsckd	hi, i am using weechat relay with weechat android on my phone so that i can keep up with things when i'm out. weechat on my computer marks channels as having unread messages despite me having read them on my phone. is there a way to get weechat to sync read status back to the relay?
2016-02-01 13:31:45	Alissa	There should be an option
2016-02-01 13:31:51	sim642	read status is not part of relay protocol
2016-02-01 13:31:57	sim642	it's part of the curses client
2016-02-01 13:31:58	Alissa	Check in #weechat-android
2016-02-01 13:32:10	Alissa	sim642: I believe it is now

2016-02-02 05:20:20	@nils_2	read docs

2016-02-02 05:21:01	gb	a computer helps, compiling with a stick in mud is tedious :-)

2016-02-02 05:21:31	hk238	piling up those commands

2016-02-02 05:22:38	gb	perhaps you could ellaborate on your needs/build environment
2016-02-02 05:23:01	hk238	linux mint
2016-02-02 05:23:44	gb	k i'd add a src line to the sorces.list and apt-get build-dep weechat-dev
2016-02-02 05:24:00	gb	that will drag in most of your needed build libs
2016-02-02 05:24:27	gb	you will still need gnutls and libcurl from memory

2016-02-02 05:35:05	hk238	so do I have to manually place those paths to like some configuration file?
2016-02-02 05:35:18	@nils_2	hk238, maybe you should learn "C" first.

2016-02-02 05:37:07	@nils_2	he want to learn programming, gb "for it's own sake, *trying* to learn programming". weechat is good structured but not the correct way to learn programming
2016-02-02 05:37:41	gb	probably should start off building something less complex i think
2016-02-02 05:37:58	hk238	well I started trying with KVirc
2016-02-02 05:38:03	gb	understand how libs, etc interact
2016-02-02 05:38:14	hk238	but it resulted to a segmentation fault
2016-02-02 05:38:27	hk238	so I thought I'd try something else.... :D
2016-02-02 05:38:45	hk238	part of the problem is also that switched to linux and I dont quite get how the filesystem works yet
2016-02-02 05:38:58	hk238	but the way I see this issue is that I have the library, but the compiler is not finding it
2016-02-02 05:39:17	hitori	nils_2: sorry, I must be blind buy I can't find an option responsible for the hotlist format
2016-02-02 05:39:19	hk238	so either it's an issue with linux path settings or an issue with the compiler configuration, or the library isnt the right one, though it has a similar name. makes sense?
2016-02-02 05:40:28	sim642	hk238: all libraries have two packages: user and developer

2016-02-02 05:46:03	hk238	speaking of which though, does it matter which libcurl (dev) package you get? There seems to be an array of choices
