2016-01-26 16:29:13	aeontech	however, it seems like right now there is no way to lookup component object by component name
2016-01-26 16:29:17	StoneCypherAW	it's almost certainly easier to accept instances rather than names
2016-01-26 16:29:21	StoneCypherAW	oh
2016-01-26 16:29:43	aeontech	i mean to say, if I have a list ['ComponentA','ComponentB'], there's no way to iterate over it and render each.
