2015-12-28 22:16:57	thasmo	sarink, you may configure a volume for the container and clone your app from outside the container into the mounted volume.  I guess that should work. You can run a command in the container with 'exec', so you can start a bash session "docker exec -it container-name bash". See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/

2015-12-29 00:23:54	azbarcea	some config file, that I want to put in the image, depends on some env (from shell - `docker build`)
2015-12-29 00:24:19	azbarcea	how can I update the Dockerfile ENV with the values from the shell env?
2015-12-29 00:24:23	azbarcea	does it make sense?
2015-12-29 00:25:04	azbarcea	I understand that configurations should be versioned, but here I'm maybe talking about configuration management of the containers
2015-12-29 00:25:40	azbarcea	but If I change the config after the container started, I cannot restart the service (pid 1)
2015-12-29 00:26:16	azbarcea	I don't yet use rancher or kubernetes for orchestration (maybe that is the issue), and I do everything from `make` (makefile)

2015-12-30 18:02:46	thasmo	Just reading about docker volumes. Do I understand correctly, that when restarting a container, it will lose all file modifications/additions etc. which are not inside data volumes? In other words, if there's an application inside the container, which periodically auto-updates itself, and the container is restarted, will the updated files etc. be lost?

2016-01-04 08:43:51	L0j1k	axppp: sure, just use the ip address instead. it doesn't require a hostname
2016-01-04 08:44:39	L0j1k	i would suggest getting a hostname though, because it is nicer, and when you start to think about reverse proxying your containers, you will need it

2016-01-04 08:46:16	L0j1k	both are possible with v2.x registry (github.com/docker/distribution has more docs)

2016-01-04 09:08:03	KoFFiE	noppelma: other option small-scale is to write some init-script per container, upstart or systemd make that pretty easy

2016-01-26 13:16:09	apaze_	aionrap1: If I'm correct, if you include the EXPOSE, publishing a port is faster (unsure though)

2016-01-26 13:18:45	apaze_	EXPOSE does not make the ports of the container accessible to the host. To do that, you must use `-p` flag

2016-01-26 21:27:29	awsmsrc	ahh super helpful
2016-01-26 21:27:41	awsmsrc	thank @srust (if it works of course :))

2016-01-26 21:27:57	srust	i haven't precisely used it that way, but that's how it looks in inspect afterwards, so I suspect it is true.
2016-01-26 21:28:05	srust	and not documented super clearly :)
2016-01-26 21:28:13	awsmsrc	yeah that was my next point

2016-01-26 21:29:23	srust	to docker it _is_ a bind mount, whether its named or not. Its just whether its the docker internal volume path, or one you provide on the host.
2016-01-26 21:29:35	srust	so probably historically done that way

2016-01-27 12:54:54	[Coke]	I have a docker-compose.yml using a dockerfile for the build. the dockerfile has RUN commands before the end; I can't reliably make these run (the compose is reusing something, even if I docker kill/rm the container it started the last time) - makes it very hard to test changes to the dockerfile. any suggestions?

2016-01-28 08:24:02	r-ku	hmm found linode's lamp image. but when i try to access apache on host via 127.0.0.1:8080 i get connection reset error. accessing it from within container via 127.0.0.1:80 works just fine. i run it as docker run -d -p 8080:80 lamp /sbin/init. is there any other configs needed on host or something?

2016-01-29 13:04:42	DrunkenDwarf	Hi all. is there a way to launch a GUI application in a docker container and just forward the window to the host machine? I've been looking into it and all I can find is vnc'ing into an xserver in the actual container. And seeing as im running this container on an AWS server I'm already RDPing into, its getting messy

"-A FORWARD -i docker0 ! -o docker0 -j ACCEPT" generated by Docker always appears before my iptables rule to deny access, even when I have the custom rule position set as 1. Anything I can do with Docker to avoid it overriding my rule?

2016-01-30 13:32:59	rrva	i'm having issues with docker stop leaving zombies (defunct state, blocked in do_exit). These are multi-process containers where pid 1 has children. How to kill these containers without doing service docker restart?

2016-01-30 13:37:17	rrva	so you mean docker stop is wrong in my special case?
2016-01-30 13:37:28	rrva	I should instead send sigterm manually?
2016-01-30 13:37:38	rrva	and wait 30s if I think that's needed?
2016-01-30 13:37:42	cpuguy83	If it takes more than 10 seconds to clean up your processes, then you should change the default timeout.
2016-01-30 13:37:49	rrva	how?
2016-01-30 13:38:09	cpuguy83	You can `docker stop -t <seconds>` or `docker kill -s TERM`
2016-01-30 13:38:23	rrva	the difference between the two being?
2016-01-30 13:38:41	rrva	what's the timeout with docker kill
2016-01-30 13:38:51	cpuguy83	`docker kill -s TERM` just does sigterm, nothing else. `docker stop` sends SIGKILL after the timeout period.
2016-01-30 13:38:59	cpuguy83	There is no timeout with `docker kill`
2016-01-30 13:39:08	rrva	ok, i think i'll try docker stop -t

2016-02-01 10:25:52	bjornet	Hi, Im trying to understand following use case: Im setting up a LAMP stack in a multi-containerized manner (the host is OSx). From my web-container I wanna assign a random port out to host (rand:80). Then I want to map my docker-deamon IP together with the rand port in the hosts hosts-file (docker-daemon-ip:rand site.local). 1. Does this make sense? 2. I know this is partly host-related but I need to get a hint. Am I thinking of this in the cor
2016-02-01 10:25:52	bjornet	way? (issue now is that the hosts-file does not support adding :port to ip in its mapping as I understand it)

2016-02-01 12:53:35	koniiiik	I've been wondering – `docker run --rm -it ubuntu:latest /usr/bin/env` lists four environment variables: PATH, HOSTNAME, TERM, and HOME.
2016-02-01 12:54:23	koniiiik	The "Env" config option of the latest ubuntu image is null, as well as the entry point.
2016-02-01 12:54:53	koniiiik	Which, in my understanding, means that those four environment variables are set by docker itself, because no shell comes into play inside the container.

2016-02-01 18:36:18	teskitoe	most platforms support online backups (DB's especially but nginx, varnish etc all support reloading configs, draining connections, etc) so you should very rarely have to go into maintenance mode. If you use a LB proxy for your web app, then it's even more of a non-issue. Your LB will just stop routing requests to the down'd container/instance and you can do whatever you want with that container/instance
2016-02-01 18:37:32	teskitoe	haproxy and varnish are both pretty good for load balancing. If on AWS you can just use ELB with ECS or EC2

2016-02-01 18:43:36	L0j1k	intellix: the way to selectively disable build cache without docker-compose being to supply --build-arg "FOO=bar" in your 'docker build' command, and then important that with "ARG FOO" in your DOckerfile at the point you would like to break the build cache. then youc an do something like feed $(date +%w) or something to --build-arg, and it will break taht cache every week (or whatever)
2016-02-01 18:43:52	L0j1k	currently docker-compose doesn't support build-args though, so you're kinda SOL wrt that

2016-02-01 20:16:04	@programmerq	alternatively, you could manually provision a host, and then use the https://get.docker.com/ script to install docker

2016-02-01 20:52:17	mcfallen	so do I run apt-get install bind9 or is there some way to avoid installing the raft of dependencies? Some more dockerish way?

2016-02-01 21:12:12	ashp	Hmm, no firewalld, just docker 1.9 (and also 1.10 tested), and I still get 30% packet loss when sending icmp traffic from inside the container :/

2016-02-01 21:13:34	ashp	L0j1k: to anywhere, 8.8.8.8 as a lazy test
2016-02-01 21:13:41	ashp	L0j1k: I get 0% packet loss outside docker, 30-50% inside
2016-02-01 21:13:51	L0j1k	what about icmp from container to host?
2016-02-01 21:14:04	L0j1k	if it were docker, i'd imagine that would also give you 30-50%
2016-02-01 21:14:24	ashp	I have an equal multipath default route, so two nic's can be taken, same weight.  If I shut one nic down docker drops to 0% packet loss
2016-02-01 21:14:29	ashp	So it's something to do with the way it NATs
2016-02-01 21:14:39	ashp	L0j1k: docker -> host is 0% packet loss too, probably as it doesn't have to leave the box
2016-02-01 21:14:42	L0j1k	i'm extremely interestd in this
2016-02-01 21:14:47	ashp	packet loss is always 0% without docker
2016-02-01 21:14:50	L0j1k	have you written this on GH?
2016-02-01 21:15:01	ashp	I haven't yet, just wanted to test 1.10 before I put together a bug report, as it's very weird
2016-02-01 21:15:07	L0j1k	also this is important probably to bring up in #docker-network
2016-02-01 21:15:13	ashp	aha, that's a better place for this!

2016-02-01 22:16:15	borg285	I've tried running the docker command with --debug=true. Is there anything like that but elsewhere some knobs?
2016-02-01 22:17:52	borg285	a slightly different question, if I wanted to rebuild docker at a specific version is that possible?

2016-02-01 22:18:34	@programmerq	borg285: what about daemon logs? definitely debug logs from daemon would be nice
2016-02-01 22:18:40	@programmerq	the client doesn't really do a whole lot
2016-02-01 22:18:57	@programmerq	it just assembles your args into json and does GET/PUT/POST for the most part
2016-02-01 22:19:07	borg285	are these the daemon log: less /var/log/docker.log
2016-02-01 22:19:19	@programmerq	the most interesting thing it does is drop out into a two-way pip for things like 'docker run -it ubuntu bash'
2016-02-01 22:19:27	@programmerq	yeah, those are daemon logs
2016-02-01 22:19:43	borg285	is pasting them here ok, or should I use pastebin?
2016-02-01 22:19:49	L0j1k	pastebin
2016-02-01 22:19:51	@programmerq	to get daemon in --debug mode, you have to run 'docker daemon --debug'
2016-02-01 22:19:54	@programmerq	definitely pastebin

2016-02-01 22:21:36	@programmerq	borg285: when you run docker, you need to have the --debug flag present is more my point
2016-02-01 22:21:42	@programmerq	normally you don't want to run two docker daemons
2016-02-01 22:21:54	@programmerq	so update your systemd unit or init script to include --debug

2016-02-02 01:16:21	b1n4ry	cpuguy83: but how does that prevent user for corrupting each others files on the host or port collisions in application
2016-02-02 01:17:01	cpuguy83	b1n4ry: port collisions is easy... and really docker will handle this itself (it'll reject the 2nd one)
2016-02-02 01:17:51	cpuguy83	b1n4ry: in terms of corrupting other people's stuff... if a user has access to the docker daemon, they have root access to the server
2016-02-02 01:18:11	cpuguy83	b1n4ry: You can use authz plugins to limit the scope of a users access

My thought was to create namespaces to isolate each container to it's own vlan-interface. The problem is that when I try to create a new docker network with the same subnet I get this message saying that the subnet is already in use.

2016-02-02 14:19:27	madhu_	 geekbri you can use the `—ip` option in the containers launched on different hosts
2016-02-02 14:19:49	madhu_	that way you can assign ip-addresses to a container that is specific to a subnet in a particular host
2016-02-02 14:20:10	geekbri	madhu_: Yeah, I was hoping there would be an option that basically says "use this network, and automatically get an IP from this subnet range"
2016-02-02 14:20:35	madhu_	if `—ip` is not used, then the docker daemon will assign ip-address from any of the available subnets

2016-02-02 14:21:35	mlaventure	dmp1ce, what are the status of the docker command in ps? I'm assuming the client are in an interruptible sleep what about the daemon?
2016-02-02 14:21:37	madhu_	ah. k8s requires subnet per-host …. hmmm.
2016-02-02 14:21:58	madhu_	geekbri: but with overlay networking, you don’t have to care about that ideally
2016-02-02 14:22:00	geekbri	madhu_: It does. Although I am not clear if I can just specify a subnet to k8 and it will pick addresses from it

2016-02-02 14:22:23	madhu_	the entire idea of overlay networking is to not worry about the underlay requirements
2016-02-02 14:22:37	dmp1ce	mlaventure: I don't know how to determine the state. It is just sitting there on 'docker version' or 'docker ps'

2016-02-02 14:22:54	geekbri	madhu_: From my reading it seems like the way k8 expects to work is that if you have an overlay with flanneld, flanneld will give each host its own entire subnet to deal with.

2016-02-02 14:25:07	geekbri	madhu_: Not sure I've made it that far yet.  I was trying to have each of my hosts use a different subnet of the overlay network. It may be possible that's just a bad path to take and I should abandon that.
2016-02-02 14:25:10	madhu_	we should be able to migrate containers from one host to other without having to restrict IP from a specific subnet
2016-02-02 14:25:30	geekbri	Well you would still be able to do that, it would only restrict things to a subnet if that is what you wanted.
2016-02-02 14:25:53	mlaventure	dmp1ce, it doesn't show the client, and it looks like the the daemon hasn't started yet
2016-02-02 14:25:55	madhu_	geekbri: sure.. but you cannot reschedule the container with the exact same `—ip` :)
2016-02-02 14:25:58	madhu_	in different hosts
2016-02-02 14:26:05	mlaventure	dmp1ce, somehow systemctl start is stuck starting it
2016-02-02 14:26:07	geekbri	Well you CAN if you aren't restricting subnets.
2016-02-02 14:26:12	jorn	is there some way to see where `docker pull` is pulling from? or to query the online revisions it sees?
2016-02-02 14:26:19	geekbri	Thats purely a matter of how you have your docker daemons and overlay network configured isn't it?

2016-02-02 14:26:50	mlaventure	jorn, both on the same system?
2016-02-02 14:26:58	geekbri	Not just the ability to relaunch a container on a new host with the same IP
2016-02-02 14:27:02	madhu_	geekbri: yes. that too
2016-02-02 14:27:14	dmp1ce	mlaventure: OK. I'm asking in #systemd how to troubleshoot the problem.
2016-02-02 14:27:20	madhu_	overlay provides multiple advantages
2016-02-02 14:27:21	mlaventure	jorn, which version do they end up with?
2016-02-02 14:27:21	geekbri	Right so that option wouldn't cause any restrictions, it would just make more options avilable.
2016-02-02 14:27:22	jorn	mlaventure: if you mean distribution, yes, both ubuntu 14.04 LTS host systems

2016-02-02 14:28:20	madhu_	but again…. Can you check the current overlay networking as is with k8s

2016-02-02 14:28:37	geekbri	Either way, im going to review the k8 networking docs again.  Maybe i Have a fundamental misunderstanding.  It seems to me that you need to have a docker bridge and an overlay network.  it also seems to me that it expects the overlay network subnet to be exclusive for the host where the pods will be.

2016-02-02 14:29:02	madhu_	geekbri: maybe the k8 networking was talking about the best practice with the default networking solution there
2016-02-02 14:29:38	geekbri	madhu_: I could very well be confused, I find the networking docs to be lacking a little.  I thought it was that the default bridge was used for INTER pod communcation, and the ovelray network was used for pod to pod (which includes cross host)
2016-02-02 14:30:06	mlaventure	jorn, hum yes I get the same, 3 vm 3 differents version. I'll try to check what's going on
2016-02-02 14:30:09	geekbri	So it seemed that it was saying even for the pod to pod it seemed to expect subnet per host. Back to the trenches.

2016-02-02 15:09:27	L0j1k	Insouciant_One: no idea when they drop, but supposedly the windows kernel is going to have something like namespaces (my eyes are white from rolling so hard), and this windows docker stuff is going to use the same API as azure's container creation API

2016-02-02 15:28:25	L0j1k	no, there is now "docker volumes" subcommand
2016-02-02 15:28:34	L0j1k	which lets you ls, rm, etc
2016-02-02 15:28:41	L0j1k	taht is the volume management function

2016-02-02 15:29:16	L0j1k	previously since youc ouldn't even list volumes, you would need a data-volume-only container just to keep a reference to your data volume, then --volumes-from that container to use the volume
2016-02-02 15:29:20	L0j1k	but now you don't need to do that

2016-02-02 15:30:04	drvannostrand	so its better to mount a directory on the host
2016-02-02 15:31:02	drvannostrand	rather than create a data only contaienr
2016-02-02 15:31:09	L0j1k	yeah, it's up to you, but i think most people prefer bind-mounted volumes vs data volumes

2016-02-02 15:31:19	L0j1k	much easier to manage and they're explicit versus implied
2016-02-02 15:32:14	L0j1k	because let's say you havea  data volume, with your php.ini. you need to modify it. with a bind-mount, it's there in /var/docker/foo/config/php.ini.... but with data volume, well... somewhere in /var/lib/docker/... and you have to drop into a shell on the container to edit it, then it's messy
